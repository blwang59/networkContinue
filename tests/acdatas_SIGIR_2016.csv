Pollick (University of Glasgow);,"92283206,318333653,306880229","The raison d'etre of IR is to satisfy human information need. But, do we really understand information need? Despite advances in the past few decades in both the IR and relevant scientific communities, this question is largely unanswered. We do not really understand how an information need emerges and how it is physically manifested. Information need refers to a complex concept: at the very initial state of the phenomenon (i.e. at a visceral level), even the searcher may not be aware of its existence. This renders the measuring of this concept (using traditional behaviour studies) nearly impossible. In this paper, we investigate the connection between an information need and brain activity. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we measured the brain activity of twenty four participants while they performed a Question Answering (Q/A) Task, where the questions were carefully selected and developed from TREC-8 and TREC 2001 Q/A Track. The results of this experiment revealed a distributed network of brain regions commonly associated with activities related to information need and retrieval and differing brain activity in processing scenarios when participants knew the answer to a given question and when they did not and needed to search. We believe our study and conclusions constitute an important step in unravelling the nature of information need and therefore better satisfying it.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,information needs;world wide web;information retrieval;artificial intelligence;computer science;

While this task was nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of timely and reliable data sources, the recent explosive growth in geo-tagged tweet data brings new opportunities to it. That said, how to extract quality local events from geo-tagged tweet streams in real time remains largely unsolved so far. We propose GeoBurst, a method that enables effective and real-time local event detection from geo-tagged tweet streams. With a novel authority measure that captures the geo-topic correlations among tweets, GeoBurst first identifies several pivots in the query window. Such pivots serve as representative tweets for potential local events and naturally attract similar tweets to form candidate events. To select truly interesting local events from the candidate list, GeoBurst further summarizes continuous tweet streams and compares the candidates against historical activities to obtain spatiotemporally bursty ones. Finally, GeoBurst also features an updating module that finds new pivots with little time cost when the query window shifts. As such, GeoBurst is capable of monitoring continuous streams in real time. We used crowdsourcing to evaluate GeoBurst on two real-life data sets that contain millions of geo-tagged tweets. The results demonstrate that GeoBurst significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, and is orders of magnitude faster.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,social media;internet privacy;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

Learning to Rank with Selection Bias in Personal Search,Xuanhui Wang (Google);Michael Bendersky (Google);Donald Metzler (Google);Marc Najork (Google);,"2487513008,2345232400,2682520147,2477457921","Click-through data has proven to be a critical resource for improving search ranking quality. Though a large amount of click data can be easily collected by search engines, various biases make it difficult to fully leverage this type of data. In the past, many click models have been proposed and successfully used to estimate the relevance for individual query-document pairs in the context of web search. These click models typically require a large quantity of clicks for each individual pair and this makes them difficult to apply in systems where click data is highly sparse due to personalized corpora and information needs, e.g., personal search. In this paper, we study the problem of how to leverage sparse click data in personal search and introduce a novel selection bias problem and address it in the learning-to-rank framework. This paper proposes a few bias estimation methods, including a novel query-dependent one that captures queries with similar results and can successfully deal with sparse data. We empirically demonstrate that learning-to-rank that accounts for query-dependent selection bias yields significant improvements in search effectiveness through online experiments with one of the world's largest personal search engines.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,selection bias;learning to rank;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

Engineering Quality and Reliability in Technology-Assisted Review,Gordon V. Cormack (University of Waterloo);Maura R. Grossman (University of Waterloo);,"2100357054,2120519955","The objective of technology-assisted review (""TAR"") is to find as much relevant information as possible with reasonable effort. Quality is a measure of the extent to which a TAR method achieves this objective, while reliability is a measure of how consistently it achieves an acceptable result. We are concerned with how to define, measure, and achieve high quality and high reliability in TAR. When quality is defined using the traditional goal-post method of specifying a minimum acceptable recall threshold, the quality and reliability of a TAR method are both, by definition, equal to the probability of achieving the threshold. Assuming this definition of quality and reliability, we show how to augment any TAR method to achieve guaranteed reliability, for a quantifiable level of additional review effort. We demonstrate this result by augmenting the TAR method supplied as the baseline model implementation for the TREC 2015 Total Recall Track, measuring reliability and effort for 555 topics from eight test collections. While our empirical results corroborate our claim of guaranteed reliability, we observe that the augmentation strategy may entail disproportionate effort, especially when the number of relevant documents is low. To address this limitation, we propose stopping criteria for the model implementation that may be applied with no additional review effort, while achieving empirical reliability that compares favorably to the provably reliable method. We further argue that optimizing reliability according to the traditional goal-post method is inconsistent with certain subjective aspects of quality, and that optimizing a Taguchi quality loss function may be more apt.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,systematic review;reliability;data mining;statistics;

Corresponding to word sense disambiguation in Natural Language Processing, we disambiguate mathematical identifiers. By regarding formulae and natural text as one monolithic information source, we are able to extract the semantics of identifiers in a process we term Mathematical Language Processing (MLP). As scientific communities tend to establish standard (identifier) notations, we use the document domain to infer the actual meaning of an identifier. Therefore, we adapt the software development concept of namespaces to mathematical notation. Thus, we learn namespace definitions by clustering the MLP results and mapping those clusters to subject classification schemata. In addition, this gives fundamental insights into the usage of mathematical notations in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Our gold standard based evaluation shows that MLP extracts relevant identifier-definitions. Moreover, we discover that identifier namespaces improve the performance of automated identifier-definition extraction, and elevate it to a level that cannot be achieved within the document context alone.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,mathematical knowledge management;brand;identifier;natural language processing;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

However, existing hashing methods for CF employ binary code learning procedures that most suffer from the challenging discrete constraints. Hence, those methods generally adopt a two-stage learning scheme composed of relaxed optimization via discarding the discrete constraints, followed by binary quantization. We argue that such a scheme will result in a large quantization loss, which especially compromises the performance of large-scale CF that resorts to longer binary codes. In this paper, we propose a principled CF hashing framework called Discrete Collaborative Filtering (DCF), which directly tackles the challenging discrete optimization that should have been treated adequately in hashing. The formulation of DCF has two advantages: 1) the Hamming similarity induced loss that preserves the intrinsic user-item similarity, and 2) the balanced and uncorrelated code constraints that yield compact yet informative binary codes. We devise a computationally efficient algorithm with a rigorous convergence proof of DCF. Through extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks, we show that DCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CF hashing techniques, e.g, though using only 8 bits, DCF is even significantly better than other methods using 128 bits.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,collaborative filtering;theoretical computer science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

In this paper we analyze a 3 month log of web search queries posed via the Cortana virtual assistant. We report that, in this environment, users frequently ask questions that implicitly pertain to the systems or devices from which they are searching (e.g., asking: [how do I take a screenshot]). Unfortunately, accurately answering these implicit system queries poses significant challenges to general web search engines, due in part to the lack of available context.

Despite demonstrating good performance on natural language processing (NLP) tasks (e.g., language modelling and machine translation, the performance of deep neural networks on information retrieval (IR) tasks has had relatively less scrutiny. Recent work in this area has mainly focused on word embeddings and neural models for short text similarity. The lack of many positive results in this area of information retrieval is partially due to the fact that IR tasks such as ranking are fundamentally different from NLP tasks, but also because the IR and neural network communities are only beginning to focus on the application of these techniques to core information retrieval problems. Given that deep learning has made such a big impact, first on speech processing and computer vision and now, increasingly, also on computational linguistics, it seems clear that deep learning will have a major impact on information retrieval and that this is an ideal time for a workshop in this area.

Fast Matrix Factorization for Online Recommendation with Implicit Feedback,Xiangnan He (National University of Singapore);Hanwang Zhang (National University of Singapore);Min-Yen Kan (National University of Singapore);Tat-Seng Chua (National University of Singapore);,"2155461083,2141833608,2146273806,2160663097","This paper contributes improvements on both the effectiveness and efficiency of Matrix Factorization (MF) methods for implicit feedback. We highlight two critical issues of existing works. First, due to the large space of unobserved feedback, most existing works resort to assign a uniform weight to the missing data to reduce computational complexity. However, such a uniform assumption is invalid in real-world settings. Second, most methods are also designed in an offline setting and fail to keep up with the dynamic nature of online data. We address the above two issues in learning MF models from implicit feedback. We first propose to weight the missing data based on item popularity, which is more effective and flexible than the uniform-weight assumption. However, such a non-uniform weighting poses efficiency challenge in learning the model. To address this, we specifically design a new learning algorithm based on the element-wise Alternating Least Squares (eALS) technique, for efficiently optimizing a MF model with variably-weighted missing data. We exploit this efficiency to then seamlessly devise an incremental update strategy that instantly refreshes a MF model given new feedback. Through comprehensive experiments on two public datasets in both offline and online protocols, we show that our implemented, open-source (https://github.com/hexiangnan/sigir16-eals) eALS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art implicit MF methods.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,coordinate descent;matrix decomposition;theoretical computer science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

When a Knowledge Base Is Not Enough: Question Answering over Knowledge Bases with External Text Data,Denis Savenkov (Emory University);Eugene Agichtein (Emory University);,"2074277926,2283615530","One of the major challenges for automated question answering over Knowledge Bases (KBQA) is translating a natural language question to the Knowledge Base (KB) entities and predicates. Previous systems have used a limited amount of training data to learn a lexicon that is later used for question answering. This approach does not make use of other potentially relevant text data, outside the KB, which could supplement the available information. We introduce a new system, Text2KB, that enriches question answering over a knowledge base by using external text data. Specifically, we revisit different phases in the KBQA process and demonstrate that text resources improve question interpretation, candidate generation and ranking. Building on a state-of-the-art traditional KBQA system, Text2KB utilizes web search results, community question answering and general text document collection data, to detect question topic entities, map question phrases to KB predicates, and to enrich the features of the candidates derived from the KB.

In the second, the user wishes to receive timely, relevant, and non-redundant update notifications for a standing information need. Despite superficial similarities, interleaved evaluation methods for web ranking cannot be directly applied to these tasks; for example, existing techniques do not account for temporality or redundancy. Our proposed evaluation methodology consists of two components: a temporal interleaving strategy and a heuristic for credit assignment to handle redundancy. By simulating user interactions with interleaved results on submitted runs to the TREC 2014 tweet timeline generation (TTG) task and the TREC 2015 real-time filtering task, we demonstrate that our methodology yields system comparisons that accurately match the result of batch evaluations.

User Behavior in Asynchronous Slow Search,Ryan Burton (University of Michigan);Kevyn Collins-Thompson (University of Michigan);,"2481387058,2088682983","Conventional Web search is predicated on returning results to users as quickly as possible. However, for some search tasks, users have reported a willingness to wait for the perfect set of results. In this work, we present the first study to analyze users' willingness to wait and their search success, when given a Web search system that embodies characteristics of slow search, where speed can be traded for an improvement in quality. We conducted a between-subjects user study involving tasks that required multiple queries to complete, providing a Web search system that gave users the option to additionally issue asynchronous queries for which results improve in relevance over time as users continued working. We analyze the resulting survey results and interaction log data to investigate how users spent their time while waiting, and how behavior and search outcomes changes when users are given the option of using a system with asynchronous slow search capabilities. We find that when given a slow search system, users are able to perceive the improvement in quality over time, and find tasks to be easier compared to a baseline conventional Web search system. Additionally, we find that users continue to issue their own queries and examine additional documents while the slow search queries are processed in the background, and use the slow search feature more effectively as they gain exposure to its behavior across tasks.

Understanding Human Language: Can NLP and Deep Learning Help?,Christopher D. Manning (Stanford University);,2149153931,"There is a lot of overlap between the core problems of information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP). An IR system gains from understanding a user need and from understanding documents, and hence being able to determine whether a document has information that satisfies the user need. Much of NLP is about the same thing: Natural language understanding aims to understand the meaning of questions and documents and meaning relationships. The exciting recent application of deep learning approaches in NLP has brought new tools for effectively understanding language semantics. In principle, there should be a lot of synergy, though in practice the concerns of IR on large systems and macro-scale understanding have tended to contrast with the emphasis in NLP on language structure and micro-scale understanding. My talk will emphasize the two topics of how NLP can contribute to understanding textual relationships and how deep learning approaches substantially aid in this goal. One basic -- and very successful tool -- has been the new generation of distributed word representations: neural word embeddings. However, beyond just word meanings, we need to understand how to compose the meanings of larger pieces of text. Two requirements for that are good ways to understand the structure of human language utterances and ways to compose their meanings. Deep learning methods can help for both tasks. Finally, we need to understand relationships between pieces of text, to be able to do tasks such as Natural Language Inference (or Recognizing Textual Entailment) and Question Answering, and I will look at some of our recent work in these areas, both with and without the help of neural networks",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,principle of compositionality;deep learning;question answering;natural language processing;machine learning;computer science;

However, their effectiveness in information retrieval is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study how to effectively use the PV model to improve ad-hoc retrieval. We propose three major improvements over the original PV model to adapt it for the IR scenario: (1) we use a document frequency-based rather than the corpus frequency-based negative sampling strategy so that the importance of frequent words will not be suppressed excessively; (2) we introduce regularization over the document representation to prevent the model overfitting short documents along with the learning iterations; and (3) we employ a joint learning objective which considers both the document-word and word-context associations to produce better word probability estimation.

Topic Modeling for Short Texts with Auxiliary Word Embeddings,Chenliang Li (Wuhan University);Haoran Wang (Wuhan University);Zhiqian Zhang (Wuhan University);Aixin Sun (Nanyang Technological University);Zongyang Ma (Nanyang Technological University);,"2133949981,2489059881,2537484923,2124989948,2111067505","For many applications that require semantic understanding of short texts, inferring discriminative and coherent latent topics from short texts is a critical and fundamental task. Conventional topic models largely rely on word co-occurrences to derive topics from a collection of documents. However, due to the length of each document, short texts are much more sparse in terms of word co-occurrences. Data sparsity therefore becomes a bottleneck for conventional topic models to achieve good results on short texts. On the other hand, when a human being interprets a piece of short text, the understanding is not solely based on its content words, but also her background knowledge (e.g., semantically related words). The recent advances in word embedding offer effective learning of word semantic relations from a large corpus. Exploiting such auxiliary word embeddings to enrich topic modeling for short texts is the main focus of this paper. To this end, we propose a simple, fast, and effective topic model for short texts, named GPU-DMM. Based on the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model, GPU-DMM promotes the semantically related words under the same topic during the sampling process by using the generalized Polya urn (GPU) model. In this sense, the background knowledge about word semantic relatedness learned from millions of external documents can be easily exploited to improve topic modeling for short texts. Through extensive experiments on two real-world short text collections in two languages, we show that GPU-DMM achieves comparable or better topic representations than state-of-the-art models, measured by topic coherence. The learned topic representation leads to the best accuracy in text classification task, which is used as an indirect evaluation.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,topic model;natural language processing;speech recognition;information retrieval;machine learning;computer science;
Searching by Talking: Analysis of Voice Queries on Mobile Web Search,Ido Guy (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev);,2669811300,"The growing popularity of mobile search and the advancement in voice recognition technologies have opened the door for web search users to speak their queries, rather than type them.

We place special emphasis on the semantic and syntactic characteristics of the two types of queries. %Our analysis suggests that voice queries focus more on audio-visual content and question answering, and less on social networking and adult domains.

A Context-aware Time Model for Web Search,Alexey Borisov (Yandex);Ilya Markov (University of Amsterdam);Maarten de Rijke (University of Amsterdam);Pavel Serdyukov (Yandex);,"2341930197,2311084885,401833296,2130450538","In web search, information about times between user actions has been shown to be a good indicator of users' satisfaction with the search results. Existing work uses the mean values of the observed times, or fits probability distributions to the observed times. This implies a context-independence assumption that the time elapsed between a pair of user actions does not depend on the context, in which the first action takes place. We validate this assumption using logs of a commercial web search engine and discover that it does not always hold. For between 37% to 80% of query-result pairs, depending on the number of observations, the distributions of click dwell times have statistically significant differences in query sessions for which a given result (i) is the first item to be clicked and (ii) is not the first. To account for this context bias effect, we propose a context-aware time model (CATM). The CATM allows us (i) to predict times between user actions in contexts, in which these actions were not observed, and (ii) to compute context-independent estimates of the times by predicting them in predefined contexts. Our experimental results show that the CATM provides better means than existing methods to predict and interpret times between user actions.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,world wide web;data mining;simulation;computer science;

It is difficult to use such click signals on non-head queries as they receive fewer clicks. In this paper, we address the challenge of dealing with torso queries on which the production ranker is performing poorly. Torso queries are queries that occur frequently enough so that they are not considered as tail queries and yet not frequently enough to be head queries either. They comprise a large portion of most commercial search engines' traffic, so the presence of a large number of underperforming torso queries can harm the overall performance significantly. We propose a practical method for dealing with such cases, drawing inspiration from the literature on learning to rank (LTR). Our method requires relatively few clicks from users to derive a strong re-ranking signal by comparing document relevance between pairs of documents instead of using absolute numbers of clicks per document. By infusing a modest amount of exploration into the ranked lists produced by a production ranker and extracting preferences between documents, we obtain substantial improvements over the production ranker in terms of page-level online metrics. We use an exploration dataset consisting of real user clicks from a large-scale commercial search engine to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We conduct further experimentation on public benchmark data using simulated clicks to gain insight into the inner workings of the proposed method.

They significantly change the way users interact with search systems, not only because of the voice control use and touch gestures, but also due to the dialogue-style nature of the interactions and their ability to preserve context across different queries. Predicting success and failure of such search dialogues is a new problem, and an important one for evaluating and further improving intelligent assistants. While clicks in web search have been extensively used to infer user satisfaction, their significance in search dialogues is lower due to the partial replacement of clicks with voice control, direct and voice answers, and touch gestures. In this paper, we propose an automatic method to predict user satisfaction with intelligent assistants that exploits all the interaction signals, including voice commands and physical touch gestures on the device. First, we conduct an extensive user study to measure user satisfaction with intelligent assistants, and simultaneously record all user interactions. Second, we show that the dialogue style of interaction makes it necessary to evaluate the user experience at the overall task level as opposed to the query level. Third, we train a model to predict user satisfaction, and find that interaction signals that capture the user reading patterns have a high impact: when including all available interaction signals, we are able to improve the prediction accuracy of user satisfaction from 71% to 81% over a baseline that utilizes only click and query features.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,user journey;computer user satisfaction;mobile search;user interface design;user;user modeling;user interface;user experience design;human computer interaction;multimedia;world wide web;computer science;

In this paper we investigate the applicability of external longitudinal resources to identify important and popular websites in the past and analyze the social bookmarking service Delicious for this purpose. The timestamped bookmarks on Delicious provide explicit cues about popular time periods in the past along with relevant descriptors. These are valuable to identify important documents in the past for a given temporal query. Focusing purely on recall, we analyzed more than 12,000 queries and find that using Delicious yields average recall values from 46% up to 100%, when limiting ourselves to the best represented queries in the considered dataset.

However, it quickly became clear to us that many IR effectiveness papers either lack significance testing or fail to report p-values and/or test statistics, which prevents us from conducting power analysis. Hence we first report on how IR researchers (fail to) report on significance test results, what types of tests they use, and how the reporting practices may have changed over the last decade.

Two Sample T-tests for IR Evaluation: Student or Welch?,Tetsuya Sakai (Waseda University);,2655523027,"There are two well-known versions of the t -test for comparing means from unpaired data: Student's t -test and Welch's t -test. While Welch's t -test does not assume homoscedasticity (i.e., equal variances), nit involves approximations. A classical textbook recommendation would be to use Student's t -test if either the two sample sizes are similar or the two sample variances are similar, and to use Welch's t -test only when both of the above conditions are violated. However, a more recent recommendation seems to be to use Welch's t -test unconditionally. Using past data from both TREC and NTCIR, the present study demonstrates that the latter advice should not be followed blindly in the context of IR system evaluation.

The advertising model brings a unique possibility for advertisers to target direct user intent communicated through a search query, usually done by displaying their ads alongside organic search results for queries deemed relevant to their products or services.

For this reason search engines often provide a service of advanced matching, which automatically finds additional relevant queries for advertisers to bid on. We present a novel advance match approach based on the idea of semantic embeddings of queries and ads. The embeddings were learned using a large data set of user search sessions, consisting of search queries, clicked ads and search links, while utilizing contextual information such as dwell time and skipped ads.

It casts a great opportunity to launch automatic conversation systems. Owing to the diversity of Web resources, a retrieval-based conversation system will be able to find at least some responses from the massive repository for any user inputs.

We incorporate the impact of multiple data inputs, and formulate various features and factors with optimization into the deep learning framework. In the experiments, we investigate the effectiveness of the proposed deep neural network structures with better combinations of all different evidence. We demonstrate significant performance improvement against a series of standard and state-of-art baselines in terms of p@1, MAP, nDCG, and MRR for conversational purposes.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,natural language processing;world wide web;information retrieval;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;
Selectively Personalizing Query Auto-Completion,Fei Cai (National University of Defense Technology);Maarten de Rijke (University of Amsterdam);,"2224987176,401833296","Query auto-completion (QAC) is being used by many of today's search engines. It helps searchers formulate queries by providing a list of query completions after entering an initial prefix of a query. To cater for a user's specific information needs, personalized QAC strategies use a searcher's search history and their profile. Is personalization consistently effective in different search contexts? We study the QAC problem by selectively personalizing the query completion list. Based on a lenient personalized QAC strategy that encodes the ranking signal as a trade-off between query popularity and search context, we propose a model for selectively personalizing query auto-completion (SP-QAC) to study this trade-off. We predict effective trade-offs based on a regression model, where the typed query prefix, clicked documents and preceding queries in the same session are used to weigh personalization in QAC. Experiments on the AOL query log show the SP-QAC model can significantly outperform a state-of-the-art personalized QAC approach.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,ranking;sargable;web search query;web query classification;query expansion;personalization;query optimization;query language;world wide web;information retrieval;database;computer science;
Using Word Embedding to Evaluate the Coherence of Topics from Twitter Data,Anjie Fang (University of Glasgow);Craig Macdonald (University of Glasgow);Iadh Ounis (University of Glasgow);Philip Habel (University of Glasgow);,"2224954495,2148910894,336997814,2066986751","Scholars often seek to understand topics discussed on Twitter using topic modelling approaches. Several coherence metrics have been proposed for evaluating the coherence of the topics generated by these approaches, including the pre-calculated Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) of word pairs and the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) word representation vectors. As Twitter data contains abbreviations and a number of peculiarities (e.g. hashtags), it can be challenging to train effective PMI data or LSA word representation. Recently, Word Embedding (WE) has emerged as a particularly effective approach for capturing the similarity among words. Hence, in this paper, we propose new Word Embedding-based topic coherence metrics. To determine the usefulness of these new metrics, we compare them with the previous PMI/LSA-based metrics. We also conduct a large-scale crowdsourced user study to determine whether the new Word Embedding-based metrics better align with human preferences. Using two Twitter datasets, our results show that the WE-based metrics can capture the coherence of topics in tweets more robustly and efficiently than the PMI/LSA-based ones.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,topic model;natural language processing;world wide web;speech recognition;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
A Dynamic Recurrent Model for Next Basket Recommendation,Feng Yu (Chinese Academy of Sciences);Qiang Liu (Chinese Academy of Sciences);Shu Wu (Chinese Academy of Sciences);Liang Wang (Chinese Academy of Sciences);Tieniu Tan (Chinese Academy of Sciences);,"2651542687,2698910997,2122580694,2226151461,2629046442","Next basket recommendation becomes an increasing concern. Most conventional models explore either sequential transaction features or general interests of users. Further, some works treat users' general interests and sequential behaviors as two totally divided matters, and then combine them in some way for next basket recommendation. Moreover, the state-of-the-art models are based on the assumption of Markov Chains (MC), which only capture local sequential features between two adjacent baskets. In this work, we propose a novel model, Dynamic REcurrent bAsket Model (DREAM), based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). DREAM not only learns a dynamic representation of a user but also captures global sequential features among baskets. The dynamic representation of a specific user can reveal user's dynamic interests at different time, and the global sequential features reflect interactions of all baskets of the user over time. Experiment results on two public datasets indicate that DREAM is more effective than the state-of-the-art models for next basket recommendation.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,recurrent neural network;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;computer science;
Fairness in Information Retrieval,Aldo Lipani (Vienna University of Technology);,1518226153,"The offline evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems is performed through the use of test collections. A test collection, in its essence, is composed of: a collection of documents, a set of topics and, a set of relevance assessments for each topic, derived from the collection of documents. Ideally, for each topic, all the documents of the test collection should be judged, but due to the dimensions of the collections of documents, and their exponential growth over the years, this practice soon became impractical. Therefore, early in IR history, this problem has been addressed through the use of the pooling method. The pooling method consists of optimizing the relevance assessment process by pooling the documents retrieved by different search engines following a particular pooling strategy. The most common one consists on pooling the top d documents of each run. The pool is constructed from systems taking part in a challenge for which the collection was made, at a specific point in time, after which the collection is generally frozen in terms of relevance judgments. This method leads to a bias called pool bias , which is the effect that documents that were not selected in the pool created from the original runs will never be considered relevant . Thereby, this bias affects the evaluation of a system that has not been part of the pool, with any IR evaluation measures, making the comparison with pooled systems unfair . IR measures have evolved over the years and become more and more complex and difficult to interpret. Witnessing a need in industry for measures that 'make sense', I focus on the problematics of the two fundamental IR evaluation measures, Precision at cut-off P @ n and Recall at cut-off $R@n$. There are two reasons to consider such 'simple' metrics: first, they are cornerstones for many other developed metrics and, second, they are easy to understand by all users. To the eyes of a practitioner, these two evaluation measures are interesting because they lead to more intuitive interpretations like, how much time people are reading useless documents (low precision), or how many relevant documents they are missing (low recall). But this last interpretation, due to the fact that recall is inversely proportional to the number of relevant documents per topic, is very difficult to be addressed if to be judged is just a portion of the collection of documents, as it is done when using the pooling method. To tackle this problem, another kind of evaluation has been developed, based on measuring how much an IR system makes documents accessible. Accessibility measures can be seen as a complementary evaluation to recall because they provide information on whether some relevant documents are not retrieved due to an unfairness in accessibility. The main goal of this Ph.D. is to increase the stability and reusability of existing test collections, when to be evaluated are systems in terms of precision, recall, and accessibility. The outcome will be: the development of a novel estimator to tackle the pool bias issue for P @ n , and R @ n , a comprehensive analysis of the effect of the estimator on varying pooling strategies, and finally, to support the evaluation of recall, an analytic approach to the evaluation of accessibility measures.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,accessibility;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

Successful deployment of crowdsourcing at scale involves adjusting many variables, a very important one being the number of workers needed per human intelligence task (HIT). We consider the crowdsourcing task of learning the answer to simple multiple-choice HITs, which are representative of many relevance experiments. In order to provide statistically significant results, one often needs to ask multiple workers to answer the same HIT. A stopping rule is an algorithm that, given a HIT, decides for any given set of worker answers to stop and output an answer or iterate and ask one more worker. In contrast to other solutions that try to estimate worker performance and answer at the same time, our approach assumes the historical performance of a worker is known and tries to estimate the HIT difficulty and answer at the same time. The difficulty of the HIT decides how much weight to give to each worker's answer. In this paper we investigate how to devise better stopping rules given workers' performance quality scores. We suggest adaptive exploration as a promising approach for scalable and automatic creation of ground truth. We conduct a data analysis on an industrial crowdsourcing platform, and use the observations from this analysis to design new stopping rules that use the workers' quality scores in a non-trivial manner. We then perform a number of experiments using real-world datasets and simulated data, showing that our algorithm performs better than other approaches.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,crowdsourcing;ground truth;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;statistics;computer science;

Such measures are referred to as interval. Pearson's rho offers one way in which correlation can be computed over results from an interval measure such that smaller errors in the gap size are preferred. When seeking to improve over existing systems, we care the most about comparisons among the best systems.

Most existing methods utilize label information to reduce the semantic gap between different modalities. However, it is usually time-consuming to manually label large-scale data.

We assume that multimodal data are pair-wised and from several semantic groups, which form hard pair-wised constraints and soft semantic group constraints respectively. Then, we formulate the unsupervised cross-modal matching problem as a non-convex joint feature learning and data grouping problem. Self-paced learning, which learns samples from 'easy' to 'complex', is further introduced to refine the grouping result. Moreover, a multimodal graph is constructed to preserve the relationship of both inter- and intra-modality similarity. An alternating minimization method is employed to minimize the non-convex optimization problem, followed by the discussion on its convergence analysis and computational complexity. Experimental results on four multimodal databases show that SCSM outperforms state-of-the-art cross-modal subspace learning methods.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;
Terms over LOAD: Leveraging Named Entities for Cross-Document Extraction and Summarization of Events,Andreas Spitz (Heidelberg University);Michael Gertz (Heidelberg University);,"2123468602,2006920297","Real world events, such as historic incidents, typically contain both spatial and temporal aspects and involve a specific group of persons. This is reflected in the descriptions of events in textual sources, which contain mentions of named entities and dates. Given a large collection of documents, however, such descriptions may be incomplete in a single document, or spread across multiple documents. In these cases, it is beneficial to leverage partial information about the entities that are involved in an event to extract missing information. In this paper, we introduce the LOAD model for cross-document event extraction in large-scale document collections. The graph-based model relies on co-occurrences of named entities belonging to the classes locations, organizations, actors, and dates and puts them in the context of surrounding terms. As such, the model allows for efficient queries and can be updated incrementally in negligible time to reflect changes to the underlying document collection. We discuss the versatility of this approach for event summarization, the completion of partial event information, and the extraction of descriptions for named entities and dates. We create and provide a LOAD graph for the documents in the English Wikipedia from named entities extracted by state-of-the-art NER tools. Based on an evaluation set of historic data that include summaries of diverse events, we evaluate the resulting graph.

Once user clusters have been found, they can be used for recommendation and personalization. So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents. Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of short text streams. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents as it is difficult to capture the users' dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (or UCT for short).

Why do you Think this Query is Difficult?: A User Study on Human Query Prediction,Stefano Mizzaro (University of Udine);Josiane Mothe (University of Toulouse);,"156657161,2141333472","Predicting if a query will be difficult for a system is important to improve retrieval effectiveness by implementing specific processing. There have been several attempts to predict difficulty, both automatically and manually; but without high accuracy at a pre-retrieval stage. In this paper, we focus rather on understanding Why a query is perceived by humans as difficult. We ran two separated but related experiments in which we asked humans to provide both a query difficulty prediction and reasons to explain their prediction. Results show that: (i) reasons can be categorized into 4 classes; (ii) reasons can be framed into closed questions to be answered on a Likert scale; and (iii) some reasons correlate in a coherent way with the human predicted numerical difficulty. On the basis of these results it is possible to derive hints to be provided to help users when formulating their queries and to avoid them to rely on their wrong perception of difficulty.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,web query classification;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;

Besides, we also test different search strategies over different types of queries, which are categorized according to their video contents. Comprehensive experimental studies have been conducted on the dataset of TRECVID 2015 video hyperlinking task.

As a consequence, even small improvements in relevance ranking both positively influence the shopping experience of millions of customers and significantly impact revenue. In the past, Amazon's product search engine consisted of several hand-tuned ranking functions using a handful of input features. A lot has changed since then. In this talk we are going to cover a number of relevance algorithms used in Amazon Search today.

Balancing Relevance Criteria through Multi-Objective Optimization,Joost van Doorn (University of Amsterdam);Daan Odijk (University of Amsterdam);Diederik M. Roijers (University of Oxford);Maarten de Rijke (University of Amsterdam);,"2399331975,1988427373,2095156080,401833296","Offline evaluation of information retrieval systems typically focuses on a single effectiveness measure that models the utility for a typical user. Such a measure usually combines a behavior-based rank discount with a notion of document utility that captures the single relevance criterion of topicality. However, for individual users relevance criteria such as credibility, reputability or readability can strongly impact the utility. Also, for different information needs the utility can be a different mixture of these criteria. Because of the focus on single metrics, offline optimization of IR systems does not account for different preferences in balancing relevance criteria. We propose to mitigate this by viewing multiple relevance criteria as objectives and learning a set of rankers that provide different trade-offs w.r.t. these objectives. We model document utility within a gain-based evaluation framework as a weighted combination of relevance criteria. Using the learned set, we are able to make an informed decision based on the values of the rankers and a preference w.r.t. the relevance criteria. On a dataset annotated for readability and a web search dataset annotated for sub-topic relevance we demonstrate how trade-offs between can be made explicit. We show that there are different available trade-offs between relevance criteria.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,multi objective optimization;learning to rank;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Applying another metric, previously used in the TREC Microblog evaluations, again yields different system rankings. We find little correlation between a number of ""reasonable"" evaluation metrics, which suggests that system effectiveness depends on how you measure it---an undesirable state in IR evaluation. However, we argue that existing evaluation metrics can be generalized into a framework that uses the same underlying contingency table, but places different weights and penalties.

Toward Estimating the Rank Correlation between the Test Collection Results and the True System Performance,Julián Urbano (Pompeu Fabra University);Mónica Marrero;,"2134191119,2144463456","The Kendall ? and AP rank correlation coefficients have become mainstream in Information Retrieval research for comparing the rankings of systems produced by two different evaluation conditions, such as different effectiveness measures or pool depths. However, in this paper we focus on the expected rank correlation between the mean scores observed with a test collection and the true, unobservable means under the same conditions. In particular, we propose statistical estimators of ? and AP correlations following both parametric and non-parametric approaches, and with special emphasis on small topic sets. Through large scale simulation with TREC data, we study the error and bias of the estimators. In general, such estimates of expected correlation with the true ranking may accompany the results reported from an evaluation experiment, as an easy to understand figure of reliability.

We are grateful to all those who chose to submit their research papers to SIGIR 2016 and gave the Program Committee an opportunity to evaluate their work for potential inclusion in the program. We are also grateful to the 61 Senior Program Committee Members, 244 Program Committee Members, and many additional reviewers for providing significant time and effort to selecting this year's conference program. This pool of committed SIGIR volunteers comes from 24 countries and over 180 institutions. The PC reviewed 341 papers for the full paper track, and accepted 62 with an acceptance rate of 18%. The top countries in terms of accepted papers (taking all author affiliations of each paper equally into account) were the U.S.A. (34%), and China (23%) with the most successful countries (as measured by how likely authors from that country were to have their papers accepted) were Russia (55% of authors had their paper accepted), Israel (50%), and Germany (45%). With 1236 authors overall, 313 were from the U.S.A and 283 from China; and 289 from the next six most represented countries combined. As has been customary for many years, SIGIR 2016 employed a two-tier double-blind review process. At least three reviewers reviewed each paper, and then the Primary Area Chair of the paper led a discussion, which was used as the basis of the meta-review. The Secondary Area Chair assigned to each paper double-checked the reviews and discussion and, in some cases, provided an additional review. The PC chairs carefully examined the reviews and associated discussion, asking for additional reviews where necessary to provide a fuller discussion or additional expert opinion. The SIGIR 2016 PC meeting operated as a virtual meeting, held over several days, in order tofacilitate the involvement of as many Senior PC members as possible. Prior to the PC meeting the PC chairs proposed a list of ""clear accepts"" and ""clear rejects"" where the meta-reviews and reviews clearly indicated a decision. Over the four days of the PC meeting, the chairs indicated which undecided papers were open for discussion, led the discussion on these papers, and made the final decision when discussions moved towards completion; overall nearly half of the submitted papers were reviewed by the chairs or at the meeting. We are grateful for the involvement of the Senior PC members in supporting this PC meeting, especially those very committed members who participated in almost every discussion. The virtual PC meeting was supplemented by a small physical meeting of the Senior PC members who attended the ECIR 2016 conference, which took place during the same week. The short paper track received 339 submissions and accepted 104 papers for what promises to be a strong short paper track. Thanks are due to Ben Carterette, Carlos Castillo, and Jaana Kekalainen, the track chairs, for arranging and managing a thorough review process for so many papers -- a huge effort for which we are very grateful. The tutorial track reviewed 20 submissions and accepted 2 full-day tutorials and 10 half-day tutorials. We are grateful to Evangelos Kanoulas and Tie-Yan Liu for leading the selection of a diverse and high quality tutorial program. The workshops track received 12 submissions and selected 7 workshop proposals. We thank Aristides Gionis and Edie Rasmussen for their efforts in producing a great set of workshops. The demos track received 35 submissions of which 21 were accepted. Many thanks are due to Craig Macdonald for chairing this track and providing us with an array of interesting demos. Brian D. Davison and Kira Radinsky organised the Doctoral Consortium, a vitally important part of the SIGIR program. Thanks to their efforts, the event received 23 submissions from doctoral students and accepted 15 of these for presentation and discussion at the consortium.

This study evaluates the relationship between two cognitive abilities ? perceptual speed and visual memory ? and searchers' behaviors and interface preferences when using two aggregated search interfaces: one that blends vertical results into the search results (blended) and one that does not (non-blended). Cognitive tests were administered to sixteen participants who subsequently performed four search tasks using the two interfaces. Participants' search interactions were logged and after searching, they rated the usability, engagement and effectiveness of each interface, as well as made comparative evaluations. Results showed that participants with low perceptual speed spent significantly more time completing tasks when using the blended interface, while those with high perceptual speed spent roughly equivalent amounts of time completing tasks with the two interfaces. Those with low perceptual speed also rated both interfaces as significantly less usable along many measures, and were less satisfied with their searches. There were also main effects for interface: participants rated the non-blended interface significantly more usable than the blended interface.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,cognition;human computer interaction;multimedia;world wide web;simulation;computer science;
Novelty based Ranking of Human Answers for Community Questions,Adi Omari (Technion – Israel Institute of Technology);David Carmel (Yahoo!);Oleg Rokhlenko (Yahoo!);Idan Szpektor (Yahoo!);,"2480507036,2088014474,2291480806,665682607","Questions and their corresponding answers within a community based question answering (CQA) site are frequently presented as top search results forWeb search queries and viewed by millions of searchers daily. The number of answers for CQA questions ranges from a handful to dozens, and a searcher would be typically interested in the different suggestions presented in various answers for a question. Yet, especially when many answers are provided, the viewer may not want to sift through all answers but to read only the top ones. Prior work on answer ranking in CQA considered the qualitative notion of each answer separately, mainly whether it should be marked as best answer. We propose to promote CQA answers not only by their relevance to the question but also by the diversification and novelty qualities they hold compared to other answers. Specifically, we aim at ranking answers by the amount of new aspects they introduce with respect to higher ranked answers (novelty), on top of their relevance estimation. This approach is common in Web search and information retrieval, yet it was not addressed within the CQA settings before, which is quite different from classic document retrieval. We propose a novel answer ranking algorithm that borrows ideas from aspect ranking and multi-document summarization, but adapts them to our scenario. Answers are ranked in a greedy manner, taking into account their relevance to the question as well as their novelty compared to higher ranked answers and their coverage of important aspects. An experiment over a collection of Health questions, using a manually annotated gold-standard dataset, shows that considering novelty for answer ranking improves the quality of the ranked answer list.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,diversification;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;

We present Lonlies, a system for estimating property values of long tail entities by leveraging their relationships to head topics and entities. We demonstrate (1) how Lonlies builds communities of entities that are relevant to a long tail entity utilizing a text corpus and a knowledge base; (2) how Lonlies determines which communities to use in the estimation process; (3) how we aggregate estimates from community entities to produce final estimates, and (4) how users interact with Lonlies to provide feedback to improve the final estimation results.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,weak entity;question answering;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Temporal Information Retrieval,Nattiya Kanhabua (Aalborg University);Avishek Anand (Leibniz University of Hanover);,"2650966062,2576154677","The study of temporal dynamics and its impact can be framed within the so-called temporal IR approaches, which explain how user behavior, document content and scale vary with time, and how we can use them in our favor in order to improve retrieval effectiveness. This half-day tutorial will outline research issues with respect to temporal dynamics, and provide a comprehensive overview of temporal IR approaches, essentially regarding processing dynamic content, temporal information extraction, temporal query analysis, and time-aware retrieval and ranking. The tutorial is structured into two sessions. During the first session, we will explain the general and wide aspects associated to temporal dynamics by focusing on the web domain, from content and structural changes to variations of user behavior and interactions. We will begin with temporal indexing and query processing. Next step, we will explain current approaches to time-aware retrieval and ranking, which can be classified into different types based on two main notions of relevance with respect to time, namely, recency-based ranking, and time-dependent ranking. In the latter session, we will describe research issues centered on determining the temporal intent of queries, and time-aware query enhancement, e.g., temporal relevance feedback, and time-aware query reformulation. In addition, we present applications in related research areas, e.g., exploration, summarization, and clustering of search results, as well as future event retrieval and prediction. To this end, we conclude our tutorial and outline future directions. This tutorial targets graduate students, researchers and practitioners in the field of information retrieval.

Accurate detection would enable many beneficial applications, such as alerting search users to controversy. Wikipedia's broad coverage and rich metadata offer a valuable resource for this problem. We hypothesize that intensities of controversy among related pages are not independent; thus, we propose a stacked model which exploits the dependencies among related pages. Our approach improves classification of controversial web pages when compared to a model that examines each page in isolation, demonstrating that controversial topics exhibit homophily. Using notions of similarity to construct a subnetwork for collective classification, rather than using the default network present in the relational data, leads to improved classification with wider applications for semi-structured datasets, with the effects most pronounced when a small set of neighbors is used.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,semi structured data;similarity;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

In addition to supporting users seeking for information that corroborates a given event, event validation can also boost the precision of automatically detected event sets by discarding false events and preserving the true ones. The system allows to specify events, retrieves candidate web documents, and assesses whether events occur in them.

Event Digest: A Holistic View on Past Events,Arunav Mishra (Max Planck Society);Klaus Berberich (Max Planck Society);,"2193995480,2064029816","For a general user, easy access to vast amounts of online information available on past events has made retrospection much harder. We propose a problem of automatic event digest generation to aid effective and efficient retrospection. For this, in addition to text, a digest should maximize the reportage of time, geolocations, and entities to present a holistic view on the past event of interest. We propose a novel divergence-based framework that selects excerpts from an initial set of pseudo-relevant documents, such that the overall relevance is maximized, while avoiding redundancy in text, time, geolocations, and named entities, by treating them as independent dimensions of an event. Our method formulates the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) for global inference to diversify across the event dimensions. Relevance and redundancy measures are defined based on JS-divergence between independent query and excerpt models estimated for each event dimension. Elaborate experiments on three real-world datasets are conducted to compare our methods against the state-of-the-art from the literature. Using Wikipedia articles as gold standard summaries in our evaluation, we find that the most holistic digest of an event is generated with our method that integrates all event dimensions.

Improving Automated Controversy Detection on the Web,Myungha Jang (University of Massachusetts Amherst);James Allan (University of Massachusetts Amherst);,"2508638950,2097030689","Automatically detecting controversy on the Web is a useful capability for a search engine to help users review web content with a more balanced and critical view. The current state-of-the art approach is to find K-Nearest-Neighbors in Wikipedia to the document query, and to aggregate their controversy scores that are automatically computed from the Wikipedia edit-history features. In this paper, we discover two major weakness in the prior work and propose modifications. First, the generated single query from document to find KNN Wikipages easily becomes ambiguous. Thus, we propose to generate multiple queries from smaller but more topically coherent paragraph of the document. Second, the automatically computed controversy scores of Wikipedia articles that depend on ""edit war"" features have a drawback that without an edit history, there can be no edit wars. To infer more reliable controversy scores for articles with little edit history, we smooth the original score from the scores of the neighbors with more established edit history. We show that the modified framework is improved by up to 5% for binary controversy classification in a publicly available dataset.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,binary classification;data science;natural language processing;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Simulating Interactive Information Retrieval: SimIIR: A Framework for the Simulation of Interaction,David Maxwell (University of Glasgow);Leif Azzopardi (University of Glasgow);,"2465962233,2163026013","Simulation provides a powerful and cost-effective approach to explore and evaluate how interactions between a searcher and system influence search behaviour and performance. With a growing interest in simulation and an increasing number of papers using such an approach, there is a need for a flexible framework for simulation. Thus, we present SimIIR, an open-source toolkit for building and conducting Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) experiments. The framework consists of a number of high level components, including the simulation, the searcher and the system, all of which must be configured. The SimIIR framework provides a series of interchangeable components. Examples of these components include the querying strategies (how simulated queries are formulated) and stopping strategies (the depth to which a searcher will examine snippets and documents) that a simulated searcher will employ. We have implemented various existing strategies so that they can be used by other researchers to not only replicate and reproduce past experiments, but also create new experiments.

White (Microsoft);,"2159093489,2720220832,2096583854","Search result examination is an important part of searching. High page load latency for landing pages (clicked results) can reduce the efficiency of the search process. Proactively prefetching landing pages in advance of clickthrough can save searchers valuable time. However, prefetching consumes resources that are wasted unless the prefetched results are requested by searchers. Balancing the costs in prefetching particular results against the benefits in reduced latency to searchers represents the search result prefetching challenge. We present methods that leverage searchers' cursor movements on search result pages in real time to dynamically estimate the result that searchers will request next. We demonstrate through large-scale log analysis that our approach significantly outperforms three strong baselines that prefetch results based on (i) the search engine result ranking, (ii) past clicks from all searchers for the query, or (iii) past clicks from the current searcher for the query.

With more and more heterogeneous components federated into search engine result pages (SERPs), it becomes difficult for traditional position-based models to accurately predict users' actual examination patterns. Therefore, a number of prior works investigate the connection between examination and users' explicit interaction behaviors (e.g.~click-through, mouse movement). Although these works gain much success in predicting users' examination behavior on SERPs, they require the collection of large scale user behavior data, which makes it impossible to predict examination behavior on newly-generated SERPs. To predict user examination on SERPs containing heterogenous components without user interaction information, we propose a new prediction model based on visual saliency map and page content features. Visual saliency, which is designed to measure the likelihood of a given area to attract human visual attention, is used to predict users' attention distribution on heterogenous search components. With an experimental search engine, we carefully design a user study in which users' examination behavior (eye movement) is recorded. Examination prediction results based on this collected data set demonstrate that visual saliency features significantly improve the performance of examination model in heterogeneous search environments.

Jose (University of Glasgow);,"92283206,2050005027,2167481407","In this paper we introduce a game scenario for crowdsourcing (CS) using incentives as a bait for careless (gambler) workers, who respond to them in a characteristic way. We hypothesise that careless workers are risk-inclined and can be detected in the game scenario by their use of time, and test this hypothesis in two steps: first, we formulate and prove a theorem stating that a risk-inclined worker will react to competition with shorter Task Completion Time (TCT) than a risk-neutral or risk-averse worker. Second, we check if the game scenario introduces a link between TCT and performance, by performing a crowdsourced evaluation using 35 topics from the TREC-8 collection. Experimental evidence confirms our hypothesis, showing that TCT can be used as a powerful discrimination factor to detect careless workers. This is a valuable result in the quest for quality assurance in CS-based micro tasks such as relevance assessment.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,crowdsourcing;chicken;game theory;world wide web;simulation;
Learning for Efficient Supervised Query Expansion via Two-stage Feature Selection,Zhiwei Zhang (Purdue University);Qifan Wang (Google);Luo Si (Purdue University);Jianfeng Gao (Microsoft);,"2232150411,2642286652,2127260490,2104437897","Query expansion (QE) is a well known technique to improve retrieval effectiveness, which expands original queries with extra terms that are predicted to be relevant. A recent trend in the literature is Supervised Query Expansion (SQE), where supervised learning is introduced to better select expansion terms. However, an important but neglected issue for SQE is its efficiency, as applying SQE in retrieval can be much more time-consuming than applying Unsupervised Query Expansion (UQE) algorithms. In this paper, we point out that the cost of SQE mainly comes from term feature extraction, and propose a Two-stage Feature Selection framework (TFS) to address this problem. The first stage is adaptive expansion decision, which determines if a query is suitable for SQE or not. For unsuitable queries, SQE is skipped and no term features are extracted at all, which reduces the most time cost. For those suitable queries, the second stage is cost constrained feature selection, which chooses a subset of effective yet inexpensive features for supervised learning. Extensive experiments on four corpora (including three academic and one industry corpus) show that our TFS framework can substantially reduce the time cost for SQE, while maintaining its effectiveness.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,query expansion;efficiency;supervised learning;information retrieval;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;

Doc2Sent2Vec: A Novel Two-Phase Approach for Learning Document Representation,"Ganesh J (International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad);Manish Gupta (Microsoft);Vasudeva Varma (International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad);","2022809773,2664163432,2704812089","Doc2Sent2Vec is an unsupervised approach to learn low-dimensional feature vector (or embedding) for a document. This embedding captures the semantics of the document and can be fed as input to machine learning algorithms to solve a myriad number of applications in the field of data mining and information retrieval. Some of these applications include document classification, retrieval, and ranking. The proposed approach is two-phased. In the first phase, the model learns a vector for each sentence in the document using a standard word-level language model. In the next phase, it learns the document representation from the sentence sequence using a novel sentence-level language model. Intuitively, the first phase captures the word-level coherence to learn sentence embeddings, while the second phase captures the sentence-level coherence to learn document embeddings. Compared to the state-of-the-art models that learn document vectors directly from the word sequences, we hypothesize that the proposed decoupled strategy of learning sentence embeddings followed by document embeddings helps the model learn accurate and rich document representations. We evaluate the learned document embeddings by considering two classification tasks: scientific article classification and Wikipedia page classification. Our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in the scientific article classification task by ?12.07% and the Wikipedia page classification task by ?6.93%, both in terms of F1 score.

We argue in this paper that the distribution of within-document frequencies across a collection is also pertinent to informativeness, a measure that has not been considered in prior work: the most informative words tend to be those whose frequency of occurrence has high variance.

Oversampling (i.e., generating synthetic training examples of the minority class) is an often used strategy to counter this problem.

Early IR theory considered both the presence or absence of all terms in the lexicon for ranking and needed to weight them all. Yet, as the size of lexicons grew and models became too complex, common weighting models preferred to aggregate only the weights of the query terms that are matched in candidate documents. Thus, unmatched term contribution in these models is only considered indirectly, such as in probability smoothing with corpus distribution, or in weight normalization by document length. In this work we propose a novel term weighting model that directly assesses the weights of unmatched terms, and show its benefits. Specifically, we propose a Learning To Rank framework, in which features corresponding to matched terms are also ""mirrored"" in similar features that account only for unmatched terms. The relative importance of each feature is learned via a click-through query log. As a test case, we consider vertical search in Community-based Question Answering(CQA) sites from Web queries. Queries that result in viewing CQA content often contain fine grained information needs and benefit more from unmatched term weighting. We assess our model both via manual evaluation and via automatic evaluation over a clickthrough log. Our results show consistent improvement in retrieval when unmatched information is taken into account.

Explicit In Situ User Feedback for Web Search Results,Jin Young Kim (Microsoft);Jaime Teevan (Microsoft);Nick Craswell (Microsoft);,"2152189701,1982462162,2009495402","Gathering evidence about whether a search result is relevant is a core concern in the evaluation and improvement of information retrieval systems. Two common sources of evidence for establishing relevance are judgements from trained assessors and logs of online user behavior. However, both are limited; it is hard for a trained assessor to know exactly what users want to find, and user behavior only provides an implicit and ambiguous signal. In this paper, we aim to address these limitations by collecting explicit feedback on web search results from users in situ as they search. When users return to the search result page via the browser back button after having clicked on a result, we ask them to provide a binary thumbs up or thumbs down judgment and text feedback. We collect in situ feedback from a large commercial search engine, and compare this feedback with the judgments provided by trained assessors. We find that in situ feedback differs significantly from traditional relevance judgments, and that it suggests a different interpretation of behavior signals, with the dwell time threshold between negative and positive in situ feedback being 87 seconds, longer than the more common heuristic of 30 seconds.

These sites allow users to post their investing opinions and suggestions in the form of microblogs. Given the growth of the posted data, a significant and challenging research problem is how to utilize the personal wisdom and different viewpoints in these opinions to help investment. Previous work aggregates sentiments related to stocks and generates buy or hold recommendations for stocks obtaining favorable votes while suggesting sell or short actions for stocks with negative votes. However, considering the fact that there always exist unreasonable or misleading posts, sentiment aggregation should be improved to be robust to noise. In this paper, we improve investment recommendation by modeling and using the quality of each investment opinion.

Ingrams: A Neuropsychological Explanation For Why People Search,Peter Bailey (Microsoft);Nick Craswell (Microsoft);,"2295915320,2009495402","Why do people start a search? Why do they stop? Why do they do what they do in-between? Our goal in this paper is to provide a simple yet general explanation for these acts that has its basis in neuropsychology and observed user behavior. We coin the term ""ingram"", as an information counterpart to Richard Semon's ?engram? or ""memory trace"". People search to create ingrams. People stop searching because they have created sufficient ingrams, or given up. We describe these acts through a pair of user models and use it to explain various user behaviors in search activity. Understanding people?s search acts in terms of ingrams may help us predict or model the interaction of people?s information needs, the queries they issue, and the information they consume. If we could observe certain decision-making acts within these activities, we might also gain new insight into the relationships between textual information and knowledge representation.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,natural language processing;world wide web;information retrieval;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

One of the key problems in search result diversification is novelty, that is, how to measure the novelty of a candidate document with respect to other documents. In the heuristic approaches, the predefined document similarity functions are directly utilized for defining the novelty. In the learning approaches, the novelty is characterized based on a set of handcrafted features. Both the similarity functions and the features are difficult to manually design in real world due to the complexity of modeling the document novelty. In this paper, we propose to model the novelty of a document with a neural tensor network. Instead of manually defining the similarity functions or features, the new method automatically learns a nonlinear novelty function based on the preliminary representation of the candidate document and other documents. New diverse learning to rank models can be derived under the relational learning to rank framework. To determine the model parameters, loss functions are constructed and optimized with stochastic gradient descent. Extensive experiments on three public TREC datasets show that the new derived algorithms can significantly outperform the baselines, including the state-of-the-art relational learning to rank models.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;

In contrast to traditional approaches, we propose to model associations as non-boolean variables, reflecting the probability that a document is informative of the expertise of a candidate. Moreover, we introduce an alternative normalization scheme that measures how discriminative a particular document-person association is in light of all associations involving either the document or the person.

Due to the popularity of Twitter, two distinct methods have been proposed to accommodate the brevity of tweets: the tweet pooling method and Twitter LDA. Both of these methods demonstrate a higher performance in producing more interpretable topics than the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) when applied on tweets. However, while various metrics have been proposed to estimate the coherence of the generated topics from tweets, the coherence of the top ranked topics, those that are most likely to be examined by users, has not been investigated. In addition, the effect of the number of generated topics K on the topic coherence scores has not been studied. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments using three topic modelling approaches over two Twitter datasets, and apply a state-of-the-art coherence metric to study the coherence of the top ranked topics and how K affects such coherence. Inspired by ranking metrics such as precision at n, we use coherence at n to assess the coherence of a topic model. To verify our results, we conduct a pairwise user study to obtain human preferences over topics. Our findings are threefold: we find evidence that Twitter LDA outperforms both LDA and the tweet pooling method because the top ranked topics it generates have more coherence; we demonstrate that a larger number of topics (K) helps to generate topics with more coherence; and finally, we show that coherence at n is more effective when evaluating the coherence of a topic model than the average coherence score.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,topic model;data science;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Fast First-Phase Candidate Generation for Cascading Rankers,Qi Wang (New York University);Constantinos Dimopoulos (New York University);Torsten Suel (New York University);,"2494487658,2225374625,2639959275","Current search engines use very complex ranking functions based on hundreds of features. While such functions return high-quality results, they create efficiency challenges as it is too costly to fully evaluate them on all documents in the union, or even intersection, of the query terms. To address this issue, search engines use a series of cascading rankers, starting with a very simple ranking function and then applying increasingly complex and expensive ranking functions on smaller and smaller sets of candidate results. Researchers have recently started studying several problems within this framework of query processing by cascading rankers; see, e.g., [5, 13, 17, 51]. We focus on one such problem, the design of the initial cascade. Thus, the goal is to very quickly identify a set of good candidate documents that should be passed to the second and further cascades. Previous work by Asadi and Lin [3, 5] showed that while a top-k computation on either the union or intersection gives good results, a further optimization using a global document ordering based on spam scores leads to a significant reduction in quality. Our contribution is to propose an alternative framework that builds specialized single-term and pairwise index structures, and then during query time selectively accesses these structures based on a cost budget and a set of early termination techniques. Using an end-to-end evaluation with a complex machine-learned ranker, we show that our approach finds candidates about an order of magnitude faster than a conjunctive top-k computation, while essentially matching the quality.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,ranking;inverted index;learning to rank;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
A General Linear Mixed Models Approach to Study System Component Effects,Nicola Ferro (University of Padua);Gianmaria Silvello (University of Padua);,"2150237769,2084520735","Topic variance has a greater effect on performances than system variance but it cannot be controlled by system developers who can only try to cope with it.

In this paper, we face the problem of studying system variance in order to better understand how much system components contribute to overall performances. To this end, we propose a methodology based on General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to develop statistical models able to isolate system variance, component effects as well as their interaction by relying on a Grid of Points (GoP) containing all the combinations of analysed components. We apply the proposed methodology to the analysis of TREC Ad-hoc data in order to show how it works and discuss some interesting outcomes of this new kind of analysis.

However, understanding within-content engagement on a web page is not a trivial task mainly because of two reasons: (1) engagement is subjective and different users may exhibit different behavioural patterns; (2) existing proxies of user engagement (e.g., clicks, dwell time) suffer from certain caveats, such as the well-known position bias, and are not as effective in discriminating between useful and non-useful components. In this paper, we conduct a crowdsourcing study and examine how users engage with a prominent web search engine component such as the knowledge module (KM) display. To this end, we collect and analyse more than 115k mouse cursor positions from 300 users, who perform a series of search tasks.

An important task in the online evaluation of rankers is using implicit user feedback for inferring preferences between rankers. Interleaving methods have been found to be efficient and sensitive, i.e. they can quickly detect even small differences in quality. It has recently been shown that multileaving methods exhibit similar sensitivity but can be more efficient than interleaving methods. This paper presents empirical results demonstrating that existing multileaving methods either do not scale well with the number of rankers, or, more problematically, can produce results which substantially differ from evaluation measures like NDCG. The latter problem is caused by the fact that they do not correctly account for the similarities that can occur between rankers being multileaved. We propose a new multileaving method for handling this problem and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms existing methods, in some cases reducing errors by as much as 50%.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,data mining;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

Retrievability: An Independent Evaluation Measure,Colin Wilkie (University of Glasgow);,2098928293,"Information Retrieval systems have traditionally been evaluated in terms of efficiency and performance. These aspects of retrieval systems, whilst very important, do not cover a crucial aspect of the system, the access it provides to the documents of the collection. Retrievability, a document centric evaluation measure, introduced by Azzopardi and Vinay, provides an alternative approach to evaluation [1]. Retrievability is the ease with which a document can be retrieved using a retrieval system. The more queries which retrieve the document, and the higher up the document is returned, the more retrievable it is. It can thus be used to describe how difficult it is to find documents in the collection given a particular configuration of a retrieval system. Unlike typical performance evaluations, performing a retrievability analysis can be done without recourse to relevancy judgements meaning there is no reliance on a test collection. This has major advantages when tuning a retrieval systems parameters as the tuning can be performed on the live collection.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,retrievability;bias;evaluation;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;

To support queries across content modalities, the system should enable cross-modal correlation and computation-efficient indexing. While hashing methods have shown great potential in achieving this goal, current attempts generally fail to learn isomorphic hash codes in a seamless scheme, that is, they embed multiple modalities in a continuous isomorphic space and separately threshold embeddings into binary codes, which incurs substantial loss of retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically, CCQ jointly finds correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into isomorphic latent space, and learns composite quantizers that convert the isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors, which can be trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time. A comprehensive set of experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CCQ against the state of the art hashing methods for both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,hash function;quantization;theoretical computer science;world wide web;information retrieval;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;

This user-centered design approach involves technology users during technology development to catch unexpected insights and successfully innovate. This paper focuses on the preliminary findings of a living lab case study to answer the question how this methodology reveals fine-grained information about users' serendipitous search behaviors. The case study involves a specific user group, media professionals who work in broadcast television and use audiovisual archives to create audiovisual content, during the development of new search algorithms for a large audiovisual archive. Research insights are based on data gathered during one co-design workshop, and ten in-depth semi-structured interviews with media professionals. Findings stipulate that these users balance socio-technical constraints and affordances during creative retrieval to (1) find exactly what is sought; and (2) increase the possibility of serendipitous, unforeseen search results. We conclude that modeling these search processes in terms of improvising with constraints and affordances enables an effective articulation and channeling of user-technology interaction insights into new technology development.

How Much Novelty is Relevant?: It Depends on Your Curiosity,Pengfei Zhao (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology);Dik Lun Lee (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology);,"2429589923,2126521602","Traditional recommendation systems (RS's) aim to recommend items that are relevant to the user's interest. Unfortunately, the recommended items will soon become too familiar to the user and hence fail to arouse her interest. Discovery-oriented recommendation systems (DORS's) complement accuracy with ""discover utilities"" (DU's) such as novelty and diversity and optimize the tradeoff between the DU's and accuracy of the recommendations. Unfortunately, DORS's ignore an important fact that different users have different appetites for DU's. That is, highly curious users can accept highly novel and diversified recommendations whereas conservative users would behave in the opposite manner. In this paper, we propose a curiosity-based recommendation system (CBRS) framework which generates recommendations with a personalized amount of DU's to fit the user's curiosity level. The major contribution of this paper is a computational model of user curiosity, called Probabilistic Curiosity Model (PCM), which is based on the curiosity arousal theory and Wundt curve in psychology research. In PCM, we model a user's curiosity with a curiosity distribution function learnt from the user's access history and compute a curiousness score for each item representing how curious the user is about the item. CBRS then selects items which are both relevant and have high curiousness score, bounded by the constraint that the amount of DU's fits the user's DU appetite. We use joint optimization and co-factorization approaches to incorporate the curiosity signal into the recommendations. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of CBRS against the baselines using a music dataset from last.fm. The results show that compared to the baselines CBRS not only provides more personalized recommendations that adapt to the user's curiosity level but also improves the recommendation accuracy.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,curiosity;personalization;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;

The availability of such a collection allows researchers to investigate, among other questions: i) the effectiveness of retrieval methods for this task, ii) how multiple representations of an information affect retrieval iii) what influences relevance assessments in this context, iv) whether automated matching of patients to trials improves patient recruitment.

Evaluating Search Result Diversity using Intent Hierarchies,Xiaojie Wang (Renmin University of China);Zhicheng Dou (Renmin University of China);Tetsuya Sakai (Waseda University);Ji Rong Wen (Renmin University of China);,"2443414991,2330149811,2655523027,2579522231","Search result diversification aims at returning diversified document lists to cover different user intents for ambiguous or broad queries. Existing diversity measures assume that user intents are independent or exclusive, and do not consider the relationships among the intents. In this paper, we introduce intent hierarchies to model the relationships among intents. Based on intent hierarchies, we propose several hierarchical measures that can consider the relationships among intents. We demonstrate the feasibility of hierarchical measures by using a new test collection based on TREC Web Track 2009-2013 diversity test collections. Our main experimental findings are: (1) Hierarchical measures are generally more discriminative and intuitive than existing measures using flat lists of intents; (2) When the queries have multilayer intent hierarchies, hierarchical measures are less correlated to existing measures, but can get more improvement in discriminative power; (3) Hierarchical measures are more intuitive in terms of diversity or relevance. The hierarchical measures using the whole intent hierarchies are more intuitive than only using the leaf nodes in terms of diversity and relevance.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,hierarchy;evaluation;knowledge management;data mining;
Risk-Sensitive Evaluation and Learning to Rank using Multiple Baselines,B. Taner Dinçer (Muğla University);Craig Macdonald (University of Glasgow);Iadh Ounis (University of Glasgow);,"1978918089,2148910894,336997814","A robust retrieval system ensures that user experience is not damaged by the presence of poorly-performing queries. Such robustness can be measured by risk-sensitive evaluation measures, which assess the extent to which a system performs worse than a given baseline system. However, using a particular, single system as the baseline suffers from the fact that retrieval performance highly varies among IR systems across topics. Thus, a single system would in general fail in providing enough information about the real baseline performance for every topic under consideration, and hence it would in general fail in measuring the real risk associated with any given system. Based upon the Chi-squared statistic, we propose a new measure ZRisk that exhibits more promise since it takes into account multiple baselines when measuring risk, and a derivative measure called GeoRisk, which enhances ZRisk by also taking into account the overall magnitude of effectiveness. This paper demonstrates the benefits of ZRisk and GeoRisk upon TREC data, and how to exploit GeoRisk for risk-sensitive learning to rank, thereby making use of multiple baselines within the learning objective function to obtain effective yet risk-averse/robust ranking systems. Experiments using 10,000 topics from the MSLR learning to rank dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed Chi-square statistic-based objective function.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,baseline;learning to rank;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

ScentBar: A Query Suggestion Interface Visualizing the Amount of Missed Relevant Information for Intrinsically Diverse Search,Kazutoshi Umemoto (Kyoto University);Takehiro Yamamoto (Kyoto University);Katsumi Tanaka (Kyoto University);,"2226906800,2167115924,2100196114","For intrinsically diverse tasks, in which collecting extensive information from different aspects of a topic is required, searchers often have difficulty formulating queries to explore diverse aspects and deciding when to stop searching. With the goal of helping searchers discover unexplored aspects and find the appropriate timing for search stopping in intrinsically diverse tasks, we propose ScentBar, a query suggestion interface visualizing the amount of important information that a user potentially misses collecting from the search results of individual queries. We define the amount of missed information for a query as the additional gain that can be obtained from unclicked search results of the query, where gain is formalized as a set-wise metric based on aspect importance, aspect novelty, and per-aspect document relevance and is estimated by using a state-of-the-art algorithm for subtopic mining and search result diversification. Results of a user study involving 24 participants showed that the proposed interface had the following advantages when the gain estimation algorithm worked reasonably: (1) ScentBar users stopped examining search results after collecting a greater amount of relevant information; (2) they issued queries whose search results contained more missed information; (3) they obtained higher gain, particularly at the late stage of their sessions; and (4) they obtained higher gain per unit time. These results suggest that the simple query visualization helps make the search process of intrinsically diverse tasks more efficient, unless inaccurate estimates of missed information are visualized.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,web query classification;query expansion;search engine;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Beyond Topical Relevance: Studying Understandability and Reliability in Consumer Health Search,João R. M. Palotti (Vienna University of Technology);,2197643117,"Nowadays people rely on search engines to explore, understand and manage their health. A recent study from Pew Internet states that one in each three adult American Internet users have used the Internet as a diagnosis tool.

A number of studies have shown that the average user experiences difficulty in understanding the content of a large portion of the results retrieved by current search engine technology. Other studies have examined how poor the quality of health information on the web can be. In the context of consumer (non-experts) health search, search engines should not only retrieve relevant information, but also promote information that is understandable by the user and that is reliable/trustable and verified.

In this study, we propose a cross-modal hashing method by following a cluster-based joint matrix factorization strategy. Our method first builds clusters for each modality separately and then generates a cross-modal cluster representation for each document. We formulate a joint matrix factorization process with the constraint that pushes the documents' representations of the different modalities and the cross-modal cluster representations into a common consensus matrix. In doing so, we capture the inter-modality, intra-modality and cluster-based similarities in a unified latent space. Finally, we present an efficient way to generate the hash codes using the maximum entropy principle and compute the binary codes for external queries.

Learning to Project and Binarise for Hashing Based Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search,Sean Moran (University of Glasgow);,2168462595,"In this paper we focus on improving the effectiveness of hashing-based approximate nearest neighbour search. Generating similarity preserving hashcodes for images has been shown to be an effective and efficient method for searching through large datasets. Hashcode generation generally involves two steps: bucketing the input feature space with a set of hyperplanes, followed by quantising the projection of the data-points onto the normal vectors to those hyperplanes. This procedure results in the makeup of the hashcodes depending on the positions of the data-points with respect to the hyperplanes in the feature space, allowing a degree of locality to be encoded into the hashcodes. In this paper we study the effect of learning both the hyperplanes and the thresholds as part of the same model. Most previous research either learn the hyperplanes assuming a fixed set of thresholds, or vice-versa. In our experiments over two standard image datasets we find statistically significant increases in retrieval effectiveness versus a host of state-of-the-art data-dependent and independent hashing models.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,locality preserving hashing;locality sensitive hashing;image retrieval;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;

The central problem in the study of relational inference is to infer unknown relations between entities from the facts given in the knowledge bases. Two popular models have been put forth recently to solve this problem, which are the latent factor models and the random-walk models, respectively. However, each of them has their pros and cons, depending on their computational efficiency and inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical random-walk inference algorithm for relational learning in large scale graph-structured knowledge bases, which not only maintains the computational simplicity of the random-walk models, but also provides better inference accuracy than related works. The improvements come from two basic assumptions we proposed in this paper. Firstly, we assume that although a relation between two entities is syntactically directional, the information conveyed by this relation is equally shared between the connected entities, thus all of the relations are semantically bidirectional. Secondly, we assume that the topology structures of the relation-specific subgraphs in knowledge bases can be exploited to improve the performance of the random-walk based relational inference algorithms. The proposed algorithm and ideas are validated with numerical results on experimental data sampled from practical knowledge bases, and the results are compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,relational calculus;inference engine;random walk;statistical relational learning;knowledge base;knowledge based systems;natural language processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

In this paper, we investigate the indexing and retrieval strategies for a mixed collection of documents, comprising of code-mixed and the monolingual documents. In particular, we address three alternative modes of indexing, namely (a) a single index for the two sub-collections; (b) a separate index for each sub-collection; and (c) a clustered index with two individual sub-collection statistics coupled with the overall one. We make use of the expected retrievability scores of the two classes of documents to empirically show that indexing strategies (a) and (b) mostly retrieve the monolingual documents at top ranks with standard retrieval approaches.

Collaborative Ranking with Social Relationships for Top-N Recommendations,Dimitrios Rafailidis (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki);Fabio Crestani (University of Lugano);,"2104576903,2303795236","Recommendation systems have gained a lot of attention because of their importance for handling the unprecedentedly large amount of available content on the Web, such as movies, music, books, etc. Although Collaborative Ranking (CR) models can produce accurate recommendation lists, in practice several real-world problems decrease their ranking performance, such as the sparsity and cold start problems. Here, to account for the fact that the selections of social friends can leverage the recommendation accuracy, we propose SCR, a Social CR model. Our model learns personalized ranking functions collaboratively, using the notion of Social Reverse Height, that is, considering how well the relevant items of users and their social friends have been ranked at the top of the list. The reason that we focus on the top of the list is that users mainly see the top-N recommendations, and not the whole ranked list.

Many highly optimized integer encoding techniques are applied to compress the inverted index and reduce the query processing time. In this paper, we propose a new grammar-based inverted index compression scheme, which can improve the performance of both index compression and query processing. Our approach identifies patterns (common subsequences of docIDs) among different posting lists and generates a context-free grammar to succinctly represent the inverted index.

On the Effectiveness of Contextualisation Techniques in Spoken Query Spoken Content Retrieval,David Nicolas Racca (Dublin City University);Gareth J. F. Jones (Dublin City University);,"2030169056,2253680186","In passage and XML retrieval, contextualisation techniques seek to improve the rank of a relevant element by considering information from its surrounding elements and its container document. Recent research has demonstrated that some of these techniques are also particularly effective in spoken content retrieval tasks (SCR). However, no previous research has directly compared contextualisation techniques in an SCR setting, nor has it studied their potential to provide robustness to speech recognition errors. In this paper, we evaluate different contextualisation techniques, including a recently proposed technique based on positional language models (PLM) on the task of retrieving relevant spoken passages in response to a spoken query. We study the benefits of these techniques when queries and documents are transcribed with increasingly higher error rates. Experimental results over the Japanese NTCIR SpokenQuery&Doc collection show that combining global and local context is beneficial for SCR and that models usually benefit from using larger amounts of context in highly noisy conditions.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,natural language processing;speech recognition;information retrieval;computer science;

The goal is to provide instant feedback to the user in terms of query completions (""instant suggestions"") or directly provide search results (""instant results"") as the user is typing their query. The need for instant search has been further amplified by the proliferation of mobile devices and services like Siri and Google Now that aim to address the user's information need as quickly as possible. Examples of instant results include web queries like ""weather san jose"" (which directly provides the current temperature), social network queries like searching for someone's name on Facebook or LinkedIn (which directly provide the people matching the query). In each of these cases, instant search constitutes a superior user experience, as opposed to making the user complete their query before the system returns a list of results on the traditional search engine results page (SERP). We consider instant search experience to be a combination of instant results and instant suggestions, with the goal of satisfying the user's information need as quickly as possible with minimal effort on the part of the user. We first present the challenges involved in putting together an instant search solution at scale, followed by a survey of IR and NLP techniques that can be used to address them. We will also conduct a hands-on session aimed at putting together an end-to-end instant search system using open source tools and publicly available data sets.

We present results from a 5 month-long naturalistic, log-based study of user interaction with Twitter, which suggest re-finding to be a regular activity and that Tweets can offer utility for longer than one might think. We shed light on re-finding strategies revealing that remembered people are used as a stepping stone to Tweets rather than searching for content directly. Bookmarking strategies reported in the literature are used infrequently as a means to re-access. Finally, we show that by using statistical modelling it is possible to predict if a Tweet has future utility and is likely to be re-found.

Modeling User Feedback in Dynamic Search and Browsing,Jiyun Luo (Georgetown University);,2115886738,"Nowadays searching for complicated information needs becomes more and more common. These complicated needs usually require the users to reform different queries and conduct multiple retrievals in a search session. There are a lot of technologies are developed to help session searches. Riccho, pseudo relevance feedback, and etc. can help finding relevant documents. xQuAD, RxQuAD, and etc. can help the user to explore. However none of these approaches alone works well in session searches, because they don't treat a search session as a whole. They can't answer questions like when to explore and when to exploit. In this work, we model session searches as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). We model user's implicit feedbacks, such as query reformulation and user clickthrough data into the POMDP framework. Further we extend the forms of user feedbacks. We implement a new search interface which allows us to capture more explicit feedbacks from users, such as passage level relevance judgments, irrelevant judgments, duplicate judgment, and etc. We propose algorithms to effectively model these feedback signals into the POMDP framework and improve session search performance.

Search-based Evaluation from Truth Transcripts for Voice Search Applications,François Mairesse (Amazon.com);Paul Raccuglia (Amazon.com);Shiv Vitaladevuni (Amazon.com);,"2499255022,2345979710,2293554109","Voice search applications are typically evaluated by comparing the predicted query to a reference human transcript, regardless of the search results returned by the query. While we find that an exact transcript match is highly indicative of user satisfaction, a transcript which does not match the reference still produces satisfactory search results a significant fraction of the time. This paper therefore proposes an evaluation method that compares the search results of the speech recognition hypotheses with the search results produced by a human transcript. Compared with a strict sentence match, a human evaluation shows that search result overlap is a better predictor of (a) user satisfaction and (b) search result click-through. Finally, we propose a model predicting the Expected Search Satisfaction Rate (ESSR), conditioned on search overlap outcomes.

In these approaches, the underlying assumption is that similar users in social networks would prefer similar items. However, in practical scenarios, social link may not be formed by common interest. For example, one general collected social network might be used for various specific recommendation scenarios. The problem of noisy social relations without interest relevance will arise to hurt the performance. Moreover, the sparsity problem of social network makes it much more challenging, due to the two-fold problem needed to be solved simultaneously, for effectively incorporating social information to benefit recommendation.

Modelling User Search Behaviour Based on Process,Mengdie Zhuang (University of Sheffield);,2711479666,"Typically, interactive information retrieval (IIR) system evaluations assess search processes and outcomes using a combination of two types of measures: 1. user perception (e.g. users? attitudes of the search experience and outcome); 2. user behaviour (e.g. time and counts of various actions including mouse and keyboard clicks). In general, we assume that they are indicative of the search outcomes (e.g. performance, opinion). However, search is a dynamic process with changing outcomes. Therefore, neither measure solely provides a holistic way of evaluating search. On one hand, user behaviour measures are only descriptive of the outcome, and are not interpretive of the process. That is to say, they lack the rationale behind why those behaviours occurred. Another problem is that some mental activities may not reflect on user behaviour [1]. The challenge with logfiles, which contain behaviour data, is the voluminous number of data points and the need to find a reliable approach to define groups or sets based on behavioural patterns. Not all users are alike and nor do they all take the same approach to search for the same things, as evidenced by the TREC, INEX and CLEF interactive tracks. On the other hand, user perception measures are acquired in such small samples that do not scale to large participant populations, and are rarely measured constantly due to the laborious and time consuming data collection methods (e.g. questionnaire, interview). Moreover, not enough emphasis is put on assessing the reliability of individual perception measures, and the wide usage of likert-type scale limits the interpretation of answers. For a holistic understanding of the search process, we need both perception and behaviour measures. I speculate that user behaviour may predict user perception, and thus we should be able to analyse large-scale files for a greater understanding of the likely human responses.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,world wide web;data mining;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

Transfer Learning for Cross-Lingual Sentiment Classification with Weakly Shared Deep Neural Networks,Guangyou Zhou (Central China Normal University);Zhao Zeng (Central China Normal University);Jimmy Xiangji Huang (York University);Tingting He (Central China Normal University);,"2633266534,2487741274,2102119894,2204855006","Cross-lingual sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of data in a label-scarce target language by exploiting labeled data from a label-rich language. The fundamental challenge of cross-lingual learning stems from a lack of overlap between the feature spaces of source language data and that of target language data. To address this challenge, previous studies have been performed to make use of the translated resources for sentiment classification in the target language, and the classification performance is far from satisfactory because of the language gap between the source language and the translated target language. In this paper, to address the above challenge, we present a novel deep neural network structure, called Weakly Shared Deep Neural Networks (WSDNNs), to transfer the cross-lingual information from a source language to a target language. To share the sentiment labels between two languages, we build multiple weakly shared layers of features.

Appearance-Based Retrieval of Mathematical Notation in Documents and Lecture Videos,Kenny Davila (Rochester Institute of Technology);,2133351590,"Large data collections containing millions of math formulae in different formats are available on-line. Retrieving math expressions from these collections is challenging. Based on the notion that visually similar formulas are related, we propose a framework for appearance-based formula retrieval in two different modalities: symbolic for text documents and image-Based for videos. We believe that we can achieve high quality formula retrieval results using the visual appearance of math notation without complex formula semantic analysis. We represent mathematical notation using different graph types to take advantage of the information available on each domain. For symbolic formula retrieval, math expressions in text formats like LaTeX are parsed to generate Symbol Layout Trees. For image-based formula retrieval, image processing techniques are used to create a graph-based image content representation. We store these graphs using an inverted index of pairs of primitives defined by the triplet (p, q, r), where p and q are the labels of two primitives connected in the graph by the path r. Retrieval is a two-stage process: candidate selection and reranking. The first stage uses pairs of primitives from the query graph to find matches in the inverted index. Each match is given an initial score using the Dice coefficient of matched pairs of primitives. The best top-K candidates from the first stage are selected for re-ranking using a detailed similarity metric. Two steps are performed for each candidate: matching and scoring. The matching step is done by searching for the largest common substructure between query and candidate graphs. Matching is related to the problem of finding the maximum common subgraph isomorphism (MCS) between two graphs. In addition, we consider label unification for symbolic formula retrieval, and our wildcard query nodes can match entire subgraphs. In the scoring step, multiple similarity criteria define a score vector used to sort candidates, either by lexicographic order or by a function of these scores. Different datasets and benchmarks will be required to evaluate each modality. For symbolic formula retrieval, we will use the most recent versions of the NTCIR MathIR Tasks benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, there are no benchmarks for large scale image-based formula retrieval. However, the same collections used for symbolic formula retrieval could be adapted by rendering math expressions to images. In addition, we will use datasets of math lecture videos for image-based formula retrieval. Traditional graded-scales of relevance used for evaluation of retrieval systems have been shown to have inconsistency issues. We plan to use pairwise candidate comparisons during our evaluation phase. Some aggregation methods exist that generate relevance scores and ideal rankings using these pairwise candidate comparisons. The proposed framework can be adapted to work for other domains like chemistry or technical diagrams where visually similar elements are usually related.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,visual word;theoretical computer science;natural language processing;world wide web;information retrieval;machine learning;computer science;

To improve the effectiveness of this information seeking task, systems have relied on the combination of many predictors by means of machine learning methods, a task also known as learning to rank (L2R). The most effective learning methods for this task are based on ensembles of tress (e.g., Random Forests) and/or boosting techniques (e.g., RankBoost, MART, LambdaMART). In this paper, we propose a general framework that smoothly combines ensembles of additive trees, specifically Random Forests, with Boosting in a original way for the task of L2R. In particular, we exploit out-of-bag samples as well as a selective weight updating strategy (according to the out-of-bag samples) to effectively enhance the ranking performance. We instantiate such a general framework by considering different loss functions, different ways of weighting the weak learners as well as different types of weak learners. In our experiments our rankers were able to outperform all state-of-the-art baselines in all considered datasets, using just a small percentage of the original training set and faster convergence rates.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,random forest;boosting;learning to rank;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;

"""Is Sven Seven?"": A Search Intent Module for Children",Nevena Dragovic (Boise State University);Ion Madrazo Azpiazu (Boise State University);Maria Soledad Pera (Boise State University);,"2344993012,2502605224,2103578975","The Internet is the biggest data-sharing platform, comprised of an immeasurable quantity of resources covering diverse topics appealing to users of all ages. Children shape tomorrow's society, so it is essential that this audience becomes agile with searching information. Although young users prefer well-known search engines, their lack of skill in formulating adequate queries and the fact that search tools were not designed explicitly with children in mind, can result in poor outcomes. The reasons for this include children's limited vocabulary, which makes it challenging to articulate information needs using short queries, or their tendency to create queries that are too long, which translates to few or irrelevant retrieved results. To enhance web search environments in response to children's behaviors and expectations, in this paper we discuss an initial effort to verify well-known issues, and identify yet to be explored ones, that affect children in formulating (natural language or keyword) queries. We also present a novel search intent module developed in response to these issues, which can seamlessly be integrated with existing search engines favored by children. The proposed module interprets a child's query and creates a shorter and more concise query to submit to a search engine, which can lead to a more successful search session. Initial experiments conducted using a sample of children queries validate the correctness of the proposed search intent module.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,search analytics;web query classification;search engine;semantic search;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;simulation;computer science;
A Novel Approach to Define and Model Contextual Features in Recommender Systems,Parisa Lak (Ryerson University);,2681602934,"Recommender Systems(RS) provide more accurate and more relevant recommendations using contextual feature(s). This accuracy improvement is at the cost of computational expenses. Therefore, finding and selecting the most relevant contextual features is an important problem. Moreover, modeling and incorporating the selected contextual features in RS algorithms has an impact on both the accuracy and computational cost. We are conducting a series of studies to detect, define, select, model and incorporate the most relevant contextual features for RS algorithms. The feature detection, definition and selection approach involves the evaluation of features derived from implicit and explicit information. The selected features from this approach can be modeled and incorporated in any selected RS algorithm. In our recent works, we also propose a series of algorithms that incorporates multiple contextual features in the baseline matrix factorization (MF) algorithm.

Improved Caching Techniques for Large-Scale Image Hosting Services,Xiao Bai 0002 (Yahoo!);Berkant Barla Cambazoglu (Yahoo!);Archie Russell (Yahoo!);,"2104717575,2044137649,2498289726","Commercial image serving systems, such as Flickr and Facebook, rely on large image caches to avoid the retrieval of requested images from the costly backend image store, as much as possible. Such systems serve the same image in different resolutions and, thus, in different sizes to different clients, depending on the properties of the clients' devices. The requested resolutions of images can be cached individually, as in the traditional caches, reducing the backend workload. However, a potentially better approach is to store relatively high-resolution images in the cache and resize them during the retrieval to obtain lower-resolution images. Having this kind of on-the-fly image resizing capability enables image serving systems to deploy more sophisticated caching policies and improve their serving performance further. In this paper, we formalize the static caching problem in image serving systems which provide on-the-fly image resizing functionality in their edge caches or regional caches. We propose two gain-based caching policies that construct a static, fixed-capacity cache to reduce the average serving time of images. The basic idea in the proposed policies is to identify the best resolution(s) of images to be cached so that the average serving time for future image retrieval requests is reduced. We conduct extensive experiments using real-life data access logs obtained from Flickr. We show that one of the proposed caching policies reduces the average response time of the service by up to 4.2% with respect to the best-performing baseline that mainly relies on the access frequency information to make the caching decisions. This improvement implies about 25% reduction in cache size under similar serving time constraints.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,false sharing;world wide web;database;real time computing;computer science;

Attribute-based polarity analysis is a fine-grained approach that computes if the opinion about an attribute of (a component of) an item is positive, negative, or neutral. The existing techniques have a number of problems, namely: they do not take into account the conditions expressed in the opinions (e.g., when they hold and when they do not), they do not generally use any contextual information (e.g., past user opinions on the same attribute), and they are not validated on big datasets (e.g., billions of messages).

The rapid development of crowdsourcing platforms led to a significant reduction of the cost of manual labeling. This makes it possible to collect very large sets of labeled documents to train a ranking algorithm. However, relevance labels acquired via crowdsourcing are typically coarse and noisy, so certain consensus models are used to measure the quality of labels and to reduce the noise. This noise is likely to affect a ranker trained on such labels, and, since none of the existing consensus models directly optimizes ranking quality, one has to apply some heuristics to utilize the output of a consensus model in a ranking algorithm, e.g., to use majority voting among workers to get consensus labels. The major goal of this paper is to unify existing approaches to consensus modeling and noise reduction within a learning to rank framework. Namely, we present a machine learning algorithm aimed at improving the performance of a ranker trained on a crowdsourced dataset by proper remapping of labels and reweighting of samples. In the experimental part, we use several characteristics of workers/labels extracted via various consensus models in order to learn the remapping and reweighting functions.

Readers check for accurate fresh news from multiple sources throughout the day using dedicated apps or social media on their smartphones and tablets. At the same time, news publishers rely more and more on social networks and citizen journalism as a frontline to breaking news. In this new era of fastflowing instant news delivery and consumption, publishers and aggregators have to overcomea great number of challenges. These include the verification or assessment of a source's reliability; the integration of news with other sources of information; real-time processing of both news content and social streams in multiple languages, in different formats and in high volumes; deduplication; entity detection and disambiguation; automatic summarization; and news recommendation. Although Information Retrieval (IR) applied to news has been a popular research area for decades, fresh approaches are needed due to the changing type and volume of media content available and the way people consume this content. Hence, the first international workshop on recent trends in News Information Retrieval (NewsIR) was held in conjunction with ECIR 2016. As part of the workshop, we released a new dataset consisting of one million news articles to the research community. The workshop was very well attended with around 70 registered participants. We received a healthy number of 19 submissions in total of which 12 were accepted for presentation. In addition to that, we were pleased to have two keynote talks by well-known experts in the field - on with an industry background (Jochen Leidner) and one from academia (Julio Gonzalo). The workshop also included a breakout session to discuss ideas for a future data challenge in news IR and closed with a focused panel discussion to reflect on the day. Throughout the day the workshop stimulated discussions around new and powerful uses of IR applied to news sources and the intersection of multiple IR tasks to solve real user problems.

Engaged or Frustrated?: Disambiguating engagement and frustration in search,Ashlee Edwards (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill);,2142396685,"One of the primary ways researchers have characterized engagement is by an increase in search actions. Another possibility is that instead of experiencing increased engagement, people who click and query frequently are actually frustrated; several studies have shown that frustration is also characterized by increases in clicking and querying behaviors. This research seeks to illuminate the differences in search behavior between participants who are engaged and frustrated, as well as investigate the effect of task interest on engagement and frustration. To accomplish this, a laboratory experiment was conducted with 40 participants. Participants completed four tasks, and responded to questionnaires that measured their engagement, frustration, and stress. Participants were asked to rank eight topics based on interest, and were given their two most interesting and two least interesting tasks. Poor search result quality was introduced to induce frustration during their most interesting and least interesting tasks. This study found that physiological signals hold some promise for disambiguating engagement and frustration, but this depends on the time frame and manner in which they are examined. Frustrated participants had significantly more skin conductance responses during the task, while engaged participants had greater increases in skin conductance during the first 60 seconds of the task. Significant main and interaction effects for interest and frustration were found for heart rate in the window analysis, indicating that heart rate fluctuations over time can be most effective in distinguishing engagement from frustration. The multilevel modeling of engagement and frustration confirmed this, showing that interest contributed significantly to the model of skin conductance, while frustration contributed significantly to the model of heart rate. This study also found that interest had a significant effect on engagement, while the frustrator effectively created frustration. Frustration also had a significant effect on selfreported stress. Participants exhibited increases in search actions such as clicks and scrolls during periods of both engagement and frustration, but a regression analyses showed that scrolls, clicks on documents, and SERP clicks were most predictive of a frustrating episode. A significant main effect for interest was found for time between queries, indicating that this could be a useful signal of engagement. A model including the physiological signals and search behaviors showed that physiological signals aided in the prediction of engagement and frustration.

Extending Faceted Search to the Open-Domain Web,Weize Kong (University of Massachusetts Amherst);,2167771460,"Faceted search enables users to navigate a multi-dimensional information space by combining keyword search with drill-down options in each facets. For example, when searching ""computer monitor"" in an e-commerce site, users can select brands and monitor types from the the provided facets {""Samsung"", ""Dell"", ""Acer"", ...} and {""LET-Lit"", ""LCD"", ""OLED"",...}. It has been used successfully for many vertical applications, including e-commerce and digital libraries. However, this idea is not well explored for general web search in an opendomain setting, even though it holds great potential for assisting multi-faceted queries and exploratory search. The goal of this work is to explore this potential by extending faceted search into the opendomain web setting, which we call Faceted Web Search. We address three fundamental issues in Faceted Web Search, namely: how to automatically generate facets (facet generation); how to re-organize search results with users' selections on facets (facet feedback); and how to evaluate generated facets and entire Faceted Web Search systems. In conventional faceted search, facets are generated in advance for an entire corpus either manually or semi-automatically, and then recommended for particular queries in most of the previous work. However, this approach is difficult to extend to the entire web due to the web's large and heterogeneous nature. We instead propose a query-dependent approach, which extracts facets for queries from their web search results. We further improve our facet generation model under a more practical scenario, where users care more about precision of presented facets than recall. The dominant facet feedback method in conventional faceted search is Boolean filtering, which filters search results by users' selections on facets. However, our investigation shows Boolean filtering is too strict when extended to the open-domain setting. Thus, we propose soft ranking models for Faceted Web Search, which expand original queries with users' selections on facets to re-rank search results. Our experiments show that the soft ranking models are more effective than Boolean filtering models for Faceted Web Search. To evaluate Faceted Web Search, we propose both intrinsic evaluation, which evaluates facet generation on its own, and extrinsic evaluation, which evaluates an entire Faceted Web Search system by its utility in assisting search clarification. We also design a method for building reusable test collections for such evaluations. Our experiments show that using the Faceted Web Search interface can significantly improve the original ranking if allowed sufficient time for user feedback on facets.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,web search query;semantic search;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;
Cold-Start Collaborative Filtering,Xiaoxue Zhao (University College London);,2222264431,"Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a technique to generate personalised recommendations for a user from a collection of correlated preferences in the past. In general, the effectiveness of CF greatly depends on the amount of available information about the target user and the target item. The cold-start problem, which describes the difficulty of making recommendations when the users or the items are new, remains a great challenge for CF. Traditionally, this problem is tackled by resorting to an additional interview process to establish the user (item) profile before making any recommendations. During this process the user's information need is not addressed. In this thesis, however, we argue that recommendations would be preferably provided right from the beginning. And the goal of solving the cold-start problem should be maximising the overall recommendation utility during all interactions with the recommender system. In other words, we should not distinguish between the informationgathering and recommendation-making phases, but seamlessly integrate them together. This mechanism naturally addresses the cold-start problem as any user (item) can immediately receive sequential recommendations without providing extra information beforehand. This thesis solves the cold-start problem in an interactive setting by focusing on four interconnected aspects. First, we consider a continuous sequential recommendation process with CF and relate it to the exploitation-exploration (EE) trade-off. By employing probabilistic matrix factorization, we obtain a structured decision space and are thus able to leverage several EE algorithms, such as Thompson sampling and upper confidence bounds, to select items. Second, we extend the sequential recommendation process to a batch mode where multiple recommendations are made at each interaction stage. We specifically discuss the case of two consecutive interaction stages, and model it with the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to obtain its exact theoretical solution. Through an indepth analysis of the POMDP value iteration solution, we identify that an exact solution can be abstracted as selecting users (items) that are not only highly relevant to the target according to the initial-stage information, but also highly correlated with other potential users (items) for the next stage. Third, we consider the intra-stage recommendation optimisation and focus on the problem of personalised item diversification. We reformulate the latent factor models using the mean-variance analysis from the portfolio theory in economics. The resulting portfolio ranking algorithm naturally captures the user's interest range and the uncertainty of the user preference by employing the variance of the learned user latent factors, leading to a diversified item list adapted to the individual user. And, finally, we relate the diversification algorithm back to the interactive process by considering inter-stage joint portfolio diversification, where the recommendations are optimised jointly with the user's past preference records.

Improved Indexing & Searching Throughput,Matthew Stephen Crane (University of Otago);,2674897568,"Information retrieval is the process of finding relevant information in large corpora of documents based on user queries. Within the discipline there are a number of open research questions and areas. This thesis presents a systematic study into improving the speed of all aspects of an information retrieval system, without such improvements having an adverse effect on the effectiveness of that system. Several key areas of the indexing process were investigated: the effect of removing spam and correcting encoding errors at indexing time; the amount of parallelism and further improvements to the indexing process; the methods of vocabulary accumulation and collision resolution within a hash table; and as part of the indexing process, a new family of hash functions for information retrieval which exploit the properties of natural language was proposed. Search performance was also investigated by examining the effects of the spam removal on search quality. A relationship between the size of a collection and the pre-calculation of retrieval scores was discovered. Overall results indicate a 30% improvement of indexing throughput. This is accompanied by a 15% increase in search quality, whilst its speed could be increased by 25% without degrading quality. The pre-calculation of retrieval scores further improves retrieval speed by up to 3--. These results were compared against other open-source indexing systems by ATIRE when participating in the SIGIR 2015 RIGOR Workshop Reproducibility Challenge. The results of this challenge show that ATIRE is the fastest indexing system (taking half the time of the next best system), and the second fastest search system using the discovered relationship.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,adversarial information retrieval;search engine indexing;throughput;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Temporal Dynamics in Information Retrieval,Stewart William Whiting (University of Glasgow);,2097264520,"Since time is an omnipresent feature of our existence, many elements of time are embedded in information itself, and related behaviours such as creation, seeking and utilisation. In IR, time can distinguish the interpretation of information, and influence the intentions and expectations of users' information seeking activity. Many time-based patterns and trends - namely temporal dynamics - are evident in streams of information behaviour by individuals and crowds. A temporal dynamic refers to a periodic regularity, or, a one-off or irregular past, present or future of a particular element (e.g., word, topic or query popularity) - driven by predictable and unpredictable time-based events and phenomena. Several challenges and opportunities related to temporal dynamics emerge in IR. This thesis explores temporal dynamics from the perspective of (i) query popularity and meaning, and (ii) word use and relationships over time. In particular, I consider how real-time temporal dynamics in information seeking should be supported for consistent user satisfaction over time, and moreover, how previously observed temporal dynamics offer a complementary dimension which can be exploited to inform more effective IR systems. Uncertainty about user expectations is a perennial problem for IR systems, further confounded by changes over time. Addressing this, IR systems can either assist the user to submit an effective query (e.g., error-free and descriptive), or better anticipate what the user is most likely to want in relevance ranking. I first explore methods to always help users formulate queries with time-aware query auto-completion capable of suggesting both recent and always popular queries. I propose and evaluate several novel approaches, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of up to +9.2% improvement above existing baselines for diverse search scenarios in different languages. Furthermore, I explore the impact of temporal dynamics on the motives behind users' information seeking, and thus how relevance itself is subject to temporal dynamics. I find the most likely meaning of ambiguous queries is affected over short and long-term periods (e.g., hours to months) by several periodic and oneoff event-driven temporal dynamics. Finally, I find that for many event-driven multi-faceted queries, relevance can often be inferred by modelling the temporal dynamics of changes in related information. IR approaches are typically based on methods which characterize the nature of information through the statistical distributions of words and phrases. I model and exploit the temporal dimension of the collection, captured by temporal dynamics, in these established IR approaches. I explore how the temporal dynamic similarity of word and phrase use in a collection can be exploited to infer temporal semantic relationships between the terms. I propose an approach to uncover a query topic's ""chronotype"" terms -- that is, its most distinctive and temporally interdependent terms, based on a mix of temporal and non-temporal evidence. Experiments demonstrate that exploiting chronotype terms in temporal query expansion leads to significantly improved retrieval performance in several time-based collections. Temporal dynamics provide both a challenge and an opportunity for IR systems. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that temporal dynamics can be used to derive tacit structure and meaning of information and information behaviour, which is valuable for improving timeaware IR system effectiveness.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,data science;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Search Engines that Learn from Their Users,Anne Schuth (University of Amsterdam);,1979729989,"More than half the world's population uses web search engines, resulting in over half a billion queries every single day. For many people, web search engines such as Baidu, Bing, Google, and Yandex are among the first resources they go to when a question arises. Moreover, for many search engines have become the most trusted route to information, more so even than traditional media such as newspapers, news websites or news channels on television. What web search engines present people with greatly influences what they believe to be true and consequently it influences their thoughts, opinions, decisions, and the actions they take. With this in mind two things are important, from an information retrieval research perspective. First, it is important to understand how well search engines (rankers) perform and secondly this knowledge should be used to improve them. This thesis is about these two topics: evaluation of search engines and learning search engines. In the first part of this thesis we investigate how user interactions with search engines can be used to evaluate search engines. In particular, we introduce a new online evaluation paradigm called multileaving that extends upon interleaving. With multileaving, many rankers can be compared at once by combining document lists from these rankers into a single result list and attributing user interactions with this list to the rankers. Then we investigate the relation between A/B testing and interleaved comparison methods. Both studies lead to much higher sensitivity of the evaluation methods, meaning that fewer user interactions are required to arrive at reliable conclusions. This has the important implication that fewer users need to be exposed to the results from possibly inferior search engines. In the second part of this thesis we turn to online learning to rank. We learn from the evaluation methods introduced and extended upon in the first part. We learn the parameters of base rankers based on user interactions. Then we use the multileaving methods as feedback in our learning method, leading to much faster convergence than existing methods. Again, the important implication is that fewer users need to be exposed to possibly inferior search engines as they adapt more quickly to changes in user preferences. The last part of this thesis is of a different nature than the earlier two parts. As opposed to the earlier chapters, we no longer study algorithms. Progress in information retrieval research has always been driven by a combination of algorithms, shared resources, and evaluation. In the last part we focus on the latter two. We introduce a new shared resource and a new evaluation paradigm. Firstly, we propose Lerot. Lerot is an online evaluation framework that allows us to simulate users interacting with a search engine. Our implementation has been released as open source software and is currently being used by researchers around the world. Secondly we introduce OpenSearch, a new evaluation paradigm involving real users of real search engines. We describe an implementation of this paradigm that has already been widely adopted by the research community through challenges at CLEF and TREC.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,search engine;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Context & Semantics in News & Web Search,Daan Odijk (University of Amsterdam);,1988427373,"This thesis presents research towards a core aim of information retrieval (IR): providing users with easy access to information. Three research themes guide the research presented in this thesis, contributing to three aspects of IR research: the domain in which an IR system is used, the users interacting with the system, and the different access scenarios in which these users engage with an IR system. Central to these research themes is the aim to gain insights into the behavior of searchers and develop algorithms to support them in their quest, whether it is a researcher exploring or studying a large collection, a web searcher struggling to find something, or a television viewer searching for related content. The first research theme is motivated by the information seeking tasks of researchers exploring and studying large collections. To enable their search on a larger scale, we propose computational methods to connect collections and to infer the perspective offered in a news story. Motivated by how historians select documents for close reading, we propose novel methods for connecting collections using automatically extracted temporal references. To illustrate how these algorithms can be used to automatically create connections between collections, we introduce a novel search interface to explore and analyze the connected collections. The interface highlights different perspectives and requires little domain knowledge. Based on how communication scientists study framing in news, we propose an automatic thematic content analysis approach. The second research theme is addressed in a mixed-methods study on how web searchers behave when they cannot find what they are looking for. Based on large-scale log analysis, crowd-sourced labeling, and predictive modeling we show behavioral differences given task success and failure. Based on these findings we propose ways in which systems can reduce struggling in search. To support searchers, we propose and evaluate algorithms that accurately predict the nature of future actions and their anticipated impact on search outcomes. Our findings have implications for the design of search systems that help searchers struggle less and succeed more. In the third and final research theme, we consider a pro-active search scenario, specifically in a live television setting. We propose algorithms that leverage contextual information to retrieve diverse related content for a leaned-back TV viewer. While watching television, people increasingly consume additional content related to what they are watching. Two methods to automatically retrieve content based on subtitles are introduced, one using entity linking, and one that uses reinforcement learning to generate effective queries for finding related content. Both methods are highly efficient and are currently used in a live television setting in near real time. Each research chapter in this thesis provides insights and algorithms that help searchers when using IR applications. For varying domains, users, and access scenarios, the research presented in this thesis improves the ease of access to information.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;computer science;
Entity Centric Information Retrieval,Xitong Liu (University of Delaware);,2651734049,"In the past decade, the prosperity of the World Wide Web has led to fast explosion of information, and there is a long-standing demand on how to access such a huge volume of information effectively and efficiently. Information Retrieval (IR) aims to tackle the challenge by exploring approaches to obtain relevant information items (e.g., documents) relevant to a given information need (e.g., query) from a huge collection of textual data (e.g., the Web). Named entity (e.g., person, location, product, event, organization) is a type of term compound widely existing in textual data. Recent advances in Information Extraction make it possible to extract entities from large volume of free text efficiently, and the research community are actively exploring whether entities would contribute to the retrieval effectiveness. In this thesis, we investigate how to leverage entities to improve retrieval in several directions. We start with finding entities with certain semantic relation, which aims at retrieving entities and their associated attributes to meet user's information need directly. This is different from traditional search paradigm in which only documents are retrieved. Entity retrieval is performed by first retrieving a list of documents and then extracting entities from those documents. We propose a novel probabilistic framework which leverages supporting documents as bridge to model the relevance between query and entities and rank entities accordingly. On the other side, we also explore how to leverage entities to improve effectiveness of ad hoc document retrieval in two directions. The first direction is entity-centric query expansion. We find related entities of query, and perform query expansion using the names and relations of related entities. Significant improvements over several state-of-the-art feedback models could be observed on multiple data collections. Besides, we explore another direction: entity-centric relevance modeling. We propose a novel retrieval approach, i.e., Latent Entity Space (LES), which models the relevance by leveraging entity profiles to represent semantic content of documents and queries. Experimental results over several TREC collections show that LES is effective on capturing latent semantic content and can significantly improve the search accuracy of several state-of-the-art retrieval models for entity-bearing queries. This thesis presents a series of research efforts on entity centric information retrieval in several directions, and reveals promising potential of entities on improving the retrieval effectiveness. With the fast curation of high-quality knowledge base, more information about entities could be easily accessed and integrated into retrieval models. We hope our work could serve as guideline for future work on leveraging entities to improve information retrieval in more applications.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,cognitive models of information retrieval;ranking;human computer information retrieval;concept search;query expansion;relevance;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Diversity-oriented Multimodal and Interactive Information Retrieval,Rodrigo Tripodi Calumby (State University of Campinas);,2067246142,"Information retrieval methods, especially considering multimedia data, have evolved towards the integration of multiple sources of evidence in the analysis of the relevance of the items considering a given user search task. In this context, for attenuating the semantic gap between low-level features extracted from the content of the digital objects and high-level semantic concepts (objects, categories, etc.) and making the systems adaptive to different user needs, interactive models have brought the user closer to the retrieval loop allowing user-system interaction mainly through implicit or explicit relevance feedback. Analogously, diversity promotion has emerged as an alternative for tackling ambiguous or underspecified queries. Additionally, several works have addressed the issue of minimizing the required user effort on providing relevance assessments while keeping an acceptable overall effectiveness This thesis discusses, proposes, and experimentally analyzes multimodal and interactive diversity-oriented information retrieval methods. This work, comprehensively covers the interactive information retrieval literature and also discusses about recent advances, the great research challenges, and promising research opportunities. We have proposed and evaluated two relevancediversity trade-off enhancement work-flows, which integrate multiple information from images, such as: visual features, textual metadata, geographic information, and user credibility descriptors. In turn, as an integration of interactive retrieval and diversity promotion techniques, for maximizing the coverage of multiple query interpretations/aspects and speeding up the information transfer between the user and the system, we have proposed and evaluated a multimodal online learning-to-rank method trained with relevance feedback over diversified results Our experimental analysis shows that the joint usage of multiple information sources positively impacted the relevance-diversity balancing algorithms. Our results also suggest that the integration of multimodal-relevance-based filtering and reranking is effective on improving result relevance and also boosts diversity promotion methods. Beyond it, with a thorough experimental analysis we have investigated several research questions related to the possibility of improving result diversity and keeping or even improving relevance in interactive search sessions. Moreover, we analyze how much the diversification effort affects overall search session results and how different diversification approaches behave for the different data modalities. By analyzing the overall and per feedback iteration effectiveness, we show that introducing diversity may harm initial results whereas it significantly enhances the overall session effectiveness not only considering the relevance and diversity, but also how early the user is exposed to the same amount of relevant items and diversity",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,relevance;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Learning Dynamic Classes of Events using Stacked Multilayer Perceptron Networks,Nattiya Kanhabua (Leibniz University of Hanover);Huamin Ren (MediaTech Institute);Thomas B. Moeslund (Aalborg University);,"2278903833,2116724095,1992979146","People often use a web search engine to find information about events of interest, for example, sport competitions, political elections, festivals and entertainment news. In this paper, we study a problem of detecting event-related queries, which is the first step before selecting a suitable time-aware retrieval model. In general, event-related information needs can be observed in query streams through various temporal patterns of user search behavior, e.g., spiky peaks for popular events, and periodicities for repetitive events. However, it is also common that users search for non-popular events, which may not exhibit temporal variations in query streams, e.g., past events recently occurred, historical events triggered by anniversaries or similar events, and future events anticipated to happen. To address the challenge of detecting dynamic classes of events, we propose a novel deep learning model to classify a given query into a predetermined set of multiple event types. Our proposed model, a Stacked Multilayer Perceptron (S-MLP) network, consists of multilayer perceptron used as a basic learning unit. We assemble stacked units to further learn complex relationships between neutrons in successive layers.

However, they do not necessarily represent implicit relations that could be hidden in a corpora. This latter issue is tackled by recent works dealing with deep representation learn ing of texts. With this in mind, we argue that embedding KBs within deep neural architectures supporting documentquery matching would give rise to fine-grained latent representations of both words and their semantic relations. In this paper, we review the main approaches of neural-based document ranking as well as those approaches for latent representation of entities and relations via KBs. We then propose some avenues to incorporate KBs in deep neural approaches for document ranking.

Report on the First SIGIR Workshop on Graph Search and Beyond (GSB'15),"Omar Alonso (Microsoft);Marti A. Hearst (University of California, Berkeley);Jaap Kamps (University of Amsterdam);","2292406529,2169348332,2088944921","Modern Web data is highly structured in terms of entities and relations from large knowledge resources, geo-temporal references and social network structure, resulting in a massivemultidimensional graph. This graph essentially unifies both the searcher and the information resources that played a fundamentally different role in traditional IR, and ""Graph Search"" offers major new ways to access relevant information. Graph search affects both query formulation (complex queries about entities and relations building on the searcher's context) as well as result exploration and discovery (slicing and dicing the information using the graph structure) in a completely personalized way. This new graph based approach introduces great opportunities, but also great challenges, in terms of data quality and data integration, user interface design, and privacy. We view the notion of ""graph search"" as searching information from your personal point of view (you are the query) over a highly structured and curated information space. This goes beyond the traditional two-term queries and ten blue links results that users are familiar with, requiring a highly interactive session covering both query formulation and result exploration. The workshop brought together researchers from a range of areas in information access, who worked together on searching information from your personal point of view over a highly structured and curated information space.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,graph database;personal information management;user interface;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
"People, Interacting with Information1",Nicholas J. Belkin (Rutgers University);,682752941,"Recent recognition in IR that people engage in information seeking sessions ; attempts to formally model search sessions; and, the move toward evaluation of IR systems over entire search sessions, are evidence of a new, broader understanding of IR's goals. This move takes IR's goal beyond identification of relevant information objects, to supporting people in achievement of the goal or task which led them to engage in information seeking. The emergence of the term, interactive information retrieval , the amount of research conducted under that rubric, and the lack of agreement about how to conduct and evaluate such research, testify to both the significance and the difficulty of addressing this new goal. In this new context, IR faces daunting challenges, including: understanding why people engage in information seeking; identifying aspects of that condition that need to be considered in supporting them in achieving their goals; designing support for evolving user goals and knowledge; and, perhaps most daunting, how to evaluate, in ways as rigorous and successful as IR evaluation has been to date, IR systems which attempt to address this broader goal. I, and others, have proposed that moving from relevance to usefulness as the main criterion for evaluation of IR system performance, could provide a basis for addressing many of these challenges. In this paper, I discuss how such a move might be implemented, some possible alternative means for addressing this broader goal for IR, and what serious attention to users of IR systems, and their interactions with information objects and systems, could mean for research and practice of IR.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,management science;knowledge management;world wide web;

Constrained Semi-supervised Learning in the Presence of Unanticipated Classes,Bhavana Bharat Dalvi (Carnegie Mellon University);,2081006310,"Traditional semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques consider the missing labels of unlabeled datapoints as latent/unobserved variables, and model these variables, and the parameters of the model, using techniques like Expectation Maximization (EM). Such semisupervised learning techniques are widely used for Automatic Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC) tasks. We consider two extensions to traditional SSL methods which make it more suitable for a variety of AKBC tasks. First, we consider jointly assigning multiple labels to each instance, with a flexible scheme for encoding constraints between assigned labels: this makes it possible, for instance, to assign labels at multiple levels from a hierarchy. Second, we account for another type of latent variable, in the form of unobserved classes. In open-domain webscale information extraction problems, it is an unrealistic assumption that the class ontology or topic hierarchy we are using is complete. Our proposed framework combines structural search for the best class hierarchy with SSL, reducing the semantic drift associated with erroneously grouping unanticipated classes with expected classes. Together, these extensions allow a single framework to handle a large number of knowledge extraction tasks, including macro-reading, noun-phrase classification, word sense disambiguation, alignment of KBs to wikipedia or on-line glossaries, and ontology extension. To summarize, this thesis argues that many AKBC tasks which have previously been addressed separately can be viewed as instances of single abstract problem: multiview semisupervised learning with an incomplete class hierarchy. In this thesis we present a generic EM framework for solving this abstract task.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,personal information management;user interface;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;
Event-based Multi-document Summarization,Luís Carlos dos Santos Marujo (Carnegie Mellon University);,1969149255,"Daily amount of news reporting real-world events is growing exponentially. At the same time, Organizations are looking for information about current and past events that affects them, such as mergers and acquisitions of companies. The Organizations need to obtain event information in a fast and summarized form to make decisions. Event-based retrieval and summarization systems offer an efficient solution to this problem. Most summarization research work uses news stories. Although this type of documents is characterized by conveying information about events, almost all work concentrates on approaches that do not take into account this aspect. The proposed multi-document summarization methods are based on the hierarchical combination of single-document summaries. We improved our multi-document summarization methods using event information. Our approach is based on a two-stage single-document\ method that extracts a collection of key phrases, which are then used in a centrality-asrelevance passage retrieval model. To adapt centrality-as-relevance single-document summarization for multi-document summarization that is able to use event information, we needed a good and adaptable baseline system. Because the key phrase extraction play a significant role in the summarization, we improved a state-of-the-art key phrase extraction toolkit using four additional sets of semantic features. The event detection method is based on Fuzzy Fingerprint, which is a supervised method trained on documents with annotated event tags. We explored three different ways to integrate event information, achieving state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-document summarization using filtering and event-based features. To cope with the possible usage of different terms to describe the same event, we explored distributed representations of text in the form of word embeddings, which contributed to improve the multi-document summarization results. The automatic evaluation and user study performed show that these methods improve upon current state-of-the-art multi-document summarization systems on two mainstream evaluation datasets, DUC 2007 and TAC 2009. We show a relative improvement in ROUGE- 1 scores of 16% for TAC 2009 and of 17% for DUC 2007. We have also obtained improvements in ROUGE-1 upon current state-of-the-art single-document summarization systems of between 32% in clean data and 19% in noisy data. These improvements derived from the inclusion of key phrases and event information. The extraction of key phrases was also refined with additional pre-processing steps and features, which lead to a relative improvement in NDCG scores of 9%. The introduction of Fuzzy Fingerprints for event detection enabled the detection of all event types, while the best competitor, an SVM with enhanced features, only detects roughly 85% of the different types of events. This lead to a large increase in the G-Mean and variants results when using the Fuzzy Fingerprints method.

Utilising Wikipedia for Text Mining Applications,"Muhammad Atif Qureshi (National University of Ireland, Galway);",2120878298,"The process whereby inferences are made from textual data is broadly referred to as text mining. In order to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the derived inferences, several approaches have been proposed for different text mining applications. Among these applications, classifying a piece of text into pre-defined classes through the utilisation of training data falls into supervised approaches while arranging related documents or terms into clusters falls into unsupervised approaches. In both these approaches, processing is undertaken at the level of documents to make sense of text within those documents. Recent research efforts have begun exploring the role of knowledge bases in solving the various problems that arise in the domain of text mining. Of all the knowledge bases, Wikipedia on account of being one of the largest human-curated, online encyclopaedia has proven to be one of the most valuable resources in dealing with various problems in the domain of text mining. However, previous Wikipedia-based research efforts have not taken both Wikipedia categories and Wikipedia articles together as a source of information. This thesis serves as a first step in eliminating this gap and throughout the contributions made in this thesis, we have shown the effectiveness of Wikipedia category-article structure for various text mining tasks. Wikipedia categories are organized in a taxonomical manner serving as semantic tags for Wikipedia articles and this provides a strong abstraction and expressive mode of knowledge representation. In this thesis, we explore the effectiveness of this mode of Wikipedia's expression (i.e., the category-article structure) via its application in the domains of text classification, subjectivity analysis (via a notion of ""perspective"" in news search), and keyword extraction. First, we show the effectiveness of exploiting Wikipedia for two classification tasks i.e., 1- classifying the tweets1 being relevant/irrelevant to an entity or brand, 2- classifying the tweets into different topical dimensions such as tweets related with workplace, innovation, etc. To do so, we define the notion of relatedness between the text in tweet and the information embedded within the Wikipedia category-article structure. Then, we present an application in the area of news search by using the same notion of relatedness to show more information related to each search result highlighting the amount perspective or subjective bias in each returned result towards a certain opinion, topical drift, etc. Finally, we present a keyword extraction strategy using community detection over the Wikipedia categories to discover related keywords arranged in different communities. The relationship between Wikipedia categories and articles is explored via a textual phrase matching framework whereby the starting point is textual phrases that match Wikipedia articles' titles/redirects. The Wikipedia articles for which a match occurs are then utilised by extraction of their associated categories, and these Wikipedia categories are used to derive various structural measures such as those relating to taxonomical depth and Wikipedia articles they contain. These measures are utilised in our proposed text classification, subjectivity analysis, and keyword extraction framework and the performance is analysed via extensive experimental evaluations. These experimental evaluations undertake comparisons with standard text mining approaches in the literature and our Wikipedia framework based on its category-article structure outperforms the standard text mining techniques.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,engineering informatics;personal information management;brand;user interface;text mining;information technology;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;

Effective and Efficient Approaches to Retrieving and Using Expertise in Social Media,Reyyan Yeniterzi (Özyeğin University);,665239631,"The recent popularity of social media is changing the way people share and acquire knowledge. Companies started using intra-organizational social media applications in order to improve the communication and collaboration among employees. In addition to their professional use, people have been using these sites in their personal lives for information acquisition purposes, such as community question answering (CQA) sites for their questions. In such environments the interactions do not always occur between users who know each other well enough to assess expertise of one another or trust the accuracy of their created content. This dissertation solves this problem by estimating topic-specific expertise scores of users which can be also used to improve the expertise related applications in social medi. Expert retrieval has been widely studied using organizational documents; however, theadditional structure and information available in social media provide the opportunity to improve the developed expert finding approaches. Such additional information includes the availability of different types of user created content, the underlying social network structure constructed from the interactions among users, such as commenting or replying, and the available temporal information coming from the timestamped user interactions. This available information is explored and approaches which use this information for more effective expertise estimation have been proposed. In particular, the main contributions of this dissertation can be summarized as follows: Content-based Retrieval: What to search for and where to search are two important factors in retrieval tasks. This dissertation focused on these questions for the expert finding task in CQA sites. Available and different types of content-based evidence are explored to find effective and also approach independent representations for both the information need (query) and user expertise. The proposed representations returned statistically significant improvements when tested with different expert retrieval algorithms. Authority Estimation: Web page authority estimation approaches have been widely adapted to user interaction networks which are constructed by using the interactions between users. Understanding the interaction and structure behind these user graphs showed us some of the limitations of these adaptations when applied to these networks. Based on these analyses, more topic-specific authority graph construction and estimation approaches, which provided consistent improvements in both accuracy and efficiency, are proposed. Temporal Modeling: Humans are dynamic in nature with changing levels of interest, expertise and availability. In order to model this dynamic nature of users, we explored the available timestamp information within social media. With using that information, a more dynamic expert identification approach, which takes into account the recent topic-specific interest of users as well as their availability, is proposed. This move from static to dynamic modeling of expertise returned statistically significant improvements, due to more effective modeling of expertise of the constantly changing users. These proposed approaches are combined in an expert identification system which has been tested on an intra-organizational blog data and a popular community question answering site's data, for three expertise estimation related tasks: identification of topic-specific expert bloggers, routing questions to users who can provide accurate and timely replies, and ranking replies based on responders question specific expertise. Statistically significant improvements are observed in all three tasks. In addition to improving the effectiveness of expert identification applications in social media, the proposed approaches are also more efficient which makes the proposed expert finding system applicable to real time environments.",2016,International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,personal information management;user interface;knowledge management;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
