Subjective interestingness of subgraph patterns,Matthijs van Leeuwen (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven);Tijl De Bie (University of Bristol);Eirini Spyropoulou (University of Bristol);Cédric Mesnage (University of Bristol);,"2143928993,2080198120,1981173521,1988021698","The utility of a dense subgraph in gaining a better understanding of a graph has been formalised in numerous ways, each striking a different balance between approximating actual interestingness and computational efficiency. A difficulty in making this trade-off is that, while computational cost of an algorithm is relatively well-defined, a pattern's interestingness is fundamentally subjective. This means that this latter aspect is often treated only informally or neglected, and instead some form of density is used as a proxy. We resolve this difficulty by formalising what makes a dense subgraph pattern interesting to a given user. Unsurprisingly, the resulting measure is dependent on the prior beliefs of the user about the graph. For concreteness, in this paper we consider two cases: one case where the user only has a belief about the overall density of the graph, and another case where the user has prior beliefs about the degrees of the vertices. Furthermore, we illustrate how the resulting interestingness measure is different from previous proposals. We also propose effective exact and approximate algorithms for mining the most interesting dense subgraph according to the proposed measure. Usefully, the proposed interestingness measure and approach lend themselves well to iterative dense subgraph discovery. Contrary to most existing approaches, our method naturally allows subsequently found patterns to be overlapping. The empirical evaluation highlights the properties of the new interestingness measure given different prior belief sets, and our approach's ability to find interesting subgraphs that other methods are unable to find.",2016,Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,principle of maximum entropy;knowledge extraction;data science;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

A popular way of performing the above task, often dubbed quantification, is to use supervised learning to train a prevalence estimator from labelled data. In this paper we propose the first online stochastic algorithms for directly optimizing (i) performance measures for quantification, and (ii) hybrid performance measures that seek to balance quantification and classification performance. We prove rigorous bounds for our algorithms which demonstrate that they exhibit optimal convergence. Our algorithms present a significant advancement in the theory of multivariate optimization.
