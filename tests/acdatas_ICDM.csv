For example, in healthcare domain, we need to learn a predictive model of a certain disease for many hospitals. The models for each hospital may be different because of the inherent differences in the distributions of the patient populations. However, the models are also closely related because of the nature of the learning tasks modeling the same disease. By simultaneously learning all the tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm performs inductive knowledge transfer among tasks to improve the generalization performance. When datasets for the learning tasks are stored at different locations, it may not always be feasible to transfer the data to provide a data centralized computing environment due to various practical issues such as high data volume and privacy. In this paper, we propose a principled MTL framework for distributed and asynchronous optimization to address the aforementioned challenges. In our framework, gradient update does not wait for collecting the gradient information from all the tasks. Therefore, the proposed method is very efficient when the communication delay is too high for some task nodes. We show that many regularized MTL formulations can benefit from this framework, including the low-rank MTL for sharedsubspace learning.

Many classical clustering models such as k-means and DBSCAN are based on heuristics algorithms and suffer from local optimal solutions and numerical instability. Recently convex clustering has received increasing attentions, which leverages the sparsity inducing norms and enjoys many attractive theoretical properties. However, convex clustering is based on Euclidean distance and is thus not robust against outlier features. Since the outlier features are very common especially when dimensionality is high, the vulnerability has greatly limited the applicability of convex clustering to analyze many real-world datasets. In this paper, we address the challenge by proposing a novel robust convex clustering method that simultaneously performs convex clustering and identifies outlier features. Specifically, the proposed method learns to decompose the data matrix into a clustering structure component and a group sparse component that captures feature outliers. We develop a block coordinate descent algorithm which iteratively performs convex clustering after outliers features are identified and eliminated. We also propose an efficient algorithm for solving the convex clustering by exploiting the structures on its dual problem. Moreover, to further illustrate the statistical stability, we present the theoretical performance bound of the proposed clustering method.

The memory and computational complexity associated with this step grow as a quadratic and cubic function of the problem dimension (the number of samples / features), respectively. To circumvent such difficulties, we propose a GCCA algorithm whose memory and computational costs scale linearly in the problem dimension and the number of nonzero data elements, respectively. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can easily handle very large sparse views whose sample and feature dimensions both exceed 100,000 – while the current approaches can only handle thousands of features / samples. Our second contribution is a distributed algorithm for GCCA, which computes the canonical components of different views in parallel and thus can further reduce the runtime significantly (by ≥ 30% in experiments) if multiple cores are available.

This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis, graph visualization, and graph clustering. Here, we explore pervasive patterns that are related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from several diverse domains. Our discoveries are as follows: (1) Mirror Pattern: coreness of vertices (i.e., maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core) is strongly correlated to their degree. (2) Core-Triangle Pattern: degeneracy of a graph (i.e., maximum k such that the k-core exists in the graph) obeys a 3-to-1 power law with respect to the count of triangles.

Our algorithmic contributions show the usefulness of these patterns.

Various studies have previously examined circadian fluctuationsof mood in this way. In this study, we investigate seasonalfluctuations in mood and mental health by analyzing the accesslogs of Wikipedia pages and the content of Twitter in the UK overa period of four years. By using standard methods of NaturalLanguage Processing, we extract daily indicators of negativeaffect, anxiety, anger and sadness from Twitter and comparethis with the overall daily traffic to Wikipedia pages aboutmental health disorders. We show that both negative affect onTwitter and access to mental health pages on Wikipedia follow anannual cycle, both peaking during the winter months. Breakingthis down into specific moods and pages, we find that peakaccess to the Wikipedia page for Seasonal Affective Disordercoincides with the peak period for the sadness indicator inTwitter content, with both most over-expressed in Novemberand December. A period of heightened anger and anxiety onTwitter partly overlaps with increased information seeking aboutstress, panic and eating disorders on Wikipedia in the late winterand early spring. Finally, we compare Twitter mood indicatorswith various weather time series, finding that negative affectand anger can be partially explained in terms of the climatictemperature and photoperiod, sadness can be partially explainedby the photoperiod and the perceived change in the photoperiod, while anxiety is partially explained by the level of precipitation.

WSNs can capture like/dislike, trust/distrust, and other social relationships between people. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting the weights of edges in such networks.

We provide axioms that these two notions need to satisfy and show that past work does not meet these requirements for WSNs.

Furthermore, we show that when compared against several individual algorithms from both the signed and unsigned social network literature, our fairness and goodness metrics almost always have the best predictive power. We then use these as features in different multiple regression models and show that we can predict edge weights on 2 Bitcoin WSNs, an Epinions WSN, 2 WSNs derived from Wikipedia, and a WSN derived from Twitter with more accurate results than past work.

Many multi-view and multi-domain network clustering methods have been developed for joint multi-network clustering. These methods typically assume there is a common clustering structure shared by all networks, and different networks can provide complementary information on this underlying clustering structure. However, this assumption is too strict to hold in many emerging real-life applications, where multiple networks have diverse data distributions. More popularly, the networks in consideration belong to different underlying groups. Only networks in the same underlying group share similar clustering structures. Better clustering performance can be achieved by considering such groups differently. As a result, an ideal method should be able to automatically detect network groups so that networks in the same group share a common clustering structure. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, ComClus, to simultaneously group and cluster multiple networks. ComClus treats node clusters as features of networks and uses them to differentiate different network groups.

Among them, a large number of networks are not only topologically structured but also have a rich set of features on nodes. These node features are usually of high dimensionality with noisy, irrelevant and redundant information, which may impede the performance of other learning tasks. Feature selection is useful to alleviate these critical issues. Nonetheless, a vast majority of existing feature selection algorithms are predominantly designed in a static setting. In reality, real-world networks are naturally dynamic, characterized by both topology and content changes. It is desirable to capture these changes to find relevant features tightly hinged with network structure continuously, which is of fundamental importance for many applications such as disaster relief and viral marketing. In this paper, we study a novel problem of time-evolving feature selection for dynamic networks in an unsupervised scenario. Specifically, we propose a TeFS framework by leveraging the temporal evolution property of dynamic networks to update the feature selection results incrementally. Experimental results show the superiority of TeFS over the state-of-the-art batch-mode unsupervised feature selection algorithms.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: noise measurementnetwork topologyfeaturefeature extractionlinear programmingdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science
Mining Summaries for Knowledge Graph Search,"Qi SongYinghui Wu (University of California, Santa Barbara)Xin Luna Dong","2584213035,2134127457,2585679071","Mining and searching heterogeneous and large knowledge graphs is challenging under real-world resource constraints such as response time.

Given a knowledge graph G, the problem is to discover k diversified summaries that maximizes the informativeness measure. Although this problem is NP-hard, we show that it is 2-approximable. We also introduce an online mining algorithm that trade-off speed and accuracy, under given resource constraints. 3) We develop query evaluation algorithms that make use of the summaries as views.

Subspace Outlier Detection in Linear Time with Randomized Hashing,Saket Sathe (IBM)Charu C. Aggarwal (IBM),"2478550524,2146335907","Outlier detection algorithms are often computationally intensive because of their need to score each point in the data.

The AAD approach is designed to operate in an interactive data exploration loop. In each iteration of this loop, our algorithm first selects a data instance to present to the expert as a potential anomaly and then the expert labels the instance as an anomaly or as a nominal data point.

Notions of density have been used in prior studies on anomaly detection, but all existing methods have been developed for unsigned networks. We develop the first algorithms for finding dense subgraphs in signed networks using semi-definite programming based rounding. We give rigorous guarantees for our algorithms, and develop a heuristic EGOSCAN which is significantly faster. We evaluate the performance of EGOSCAN for different notions of density, and observe that it performs significantly better than natural adaptations of prior algorithms for unsigned networks. In particular, the improvement in edge density over previous methods is as much as 85% and usually over 50%. These results are consistent across signed and unsigned networks in different domains. The improvement in performance is even more significant for a constrained version of the problem involving finding subgraphs containing a subset of query nodes. We also develop an event detection method for signed and unsigned networks based on subgraph density.

It is therefore hard to acquire a deeper understanding of model behavior, and in particular how different features influence the model prediction. This is important when interpreting the behavior of complex models, or asserting that certain problematic attributes (like race or gender) are not unduly influencing decisions. In this paper, we present a technique for auditing black-box models, which lets us study the extent to which existing models take advantage of particular features in the dataset, without knowing how the models work. Our work focuses on the problem of indirect influence: how some features might indirectly influence outcomes via other, related features. As a result, we can find attribute influences even in cases where, upon further direct examination of the model, the attribute is not referred to by the model at all. Our approach does not require the black-box model to be retrained. This is important if (for example) the model is only accessible via an API, and contrasts our work with other methods that investigate feature influence like feature selection.

Because of the exploratory nature of this task, it would be beneficial if a clustering method generates interpretable results, and allows incorporating domain knowledge.

DReaM gives interpretable clustering results, because the rectangular decision rules discovered explicitly illustrate how one cluster is defined and differs from other clusters. It also facilitates us to take advantage of existing rules because we can choose informative prior distributions for the rectangular rules. Moreover, DReaM allows that the features for generating rules do not have to be the same as the features for discovering cluster structure. We approximate the distribution for the rules discovered via variational inference. Experimental results demonstrate that DReaM gives more interpretable clustering results, and yet its performance is comparable to existing clustering methods when solving traditional clustering. Furthermore, in real applications, DReaM is able to effectively take advantage of domain knowledge, and to generate reasonable clustering results.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: brown clusteringcanopy clustering algorithmcorrelation clusteringconstrained clusteringcure data clustering algorithmfuzzy clusteringdata modelingclustering high dimensional dataprobabilistic logicdecision treecluster analysismathematical modelconceptual clusteringgenomicsdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Recent studies have proposed approaches to address this challenge by weighing training instances based on density ratio between test and training data distributions. Kernel Mean Matching (KMM) is a well known method for estimating density ratio, but has time complexity cubic in the size of training data. Therefore, KMM is not suitable in real-world applications, especially in cases where the predictive model needs to be updated periodically with large training data.

Methods based on Markov assumption are widely-used, but independently combine several most recent components.

In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Context-Aware Recurrent Neural Networks (CA-RNN). Instead of using the constant input matrix and transition matrix in conventional RNN models, CA-RNN employs adaptive context-specific input matrices and adaptive context-specific transition matrices. The adaptive context-specific input matrices capture external situations where user behaviors happen, such as time, location, weather and so on. And the adaptive context-specific transition matrices capture how lengths of time intervals between adjacent behaviors in historical sequences affect the transition of global sequential features.

We show that the scalability of Hogwild! on modern multi-socket CPUs is severely limited, especially on NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) system, due to the excessive cache invalidation requests and false sharing. In this paper we propose a novel decentralized asynchronous SGD algorithm called HogWild++ that overcomes these drawbacks and shows almost linear speedup on multi-socket NUMA systems. The main idea in HogWild++ is to replace the global model vector with a set of local model vectors that are shared by a cluster (a set of cores), keep them synchronized through a decentralized token-based protocol that minimizes remote memory access conflicts and ensures convergence.

Our goal is to relate the rise of this party to some quantitative measures of their social media usage. A particular focus will be placed on users that interact with AfD content as well as with content of other parties. Our analysis is based on more than 11 million interactions of more than one million users with the public Facebook pages of the major German political parties during the years 2014 and 2015. Investigating the time courses of social media activity and user interaction, we find that the rise of the AfD can be associated with an amount of social media coverage and user engagement that is unprecedented in the German political landscape. One main effect of this campaign is a substantial increase of user interactions with other parties from the right spectrum, suggesting a migration of voters from established right wing parties.

Fixing the Convergence Problems in Parallel Asynchronous Dual Coordinate Descent,Huan ZhangCho-Jui Hsieh (University of Texas at Austin),"2250563402,2148022289","Solving L2-regularized empirical risk minimization (e.g., linear SVMs and logistic regression) using multiple cores has become an important research topic. Among all the existing algorithms, Parallel ASynchronous Stochastic dual Co-Ordinate DEscent (PASSCoDe) demonstrates superior performance compared with other methods. Although PASSCoDe is fast when it converges, the algorithm has been observed to diverge on several cases especially when a relatively large number of threads are used. This is mainly due to the delayed parameter access problem — the parameters used for the current update may be delayed and are not the latest ones. In theory, the algorithm converges only when the delay is small enough, but in practice the delay depends on the underlying parallel computing environment and cannot be guaranteed. In this work, we propose a simple and computational efficient way to fix the convergence problem of PASSCoDe. Instead of allowing all worker threads to conduct asynchronous updates wildly, we add periodic check points to the procedure, where all workers need to stop and refine the current solution at each check point. The resulting ""semi-asynchronous"" algorithm is guaranteed to converge for any problem even when PASSCoDe diverges, and for the cases where PASSCoDe converges they have almost identical speed.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: instruction setlogisticssupport vector machineconvergencerisk managementtheoretical computer sciencedistributed computingdata miningmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

It can give the user an idea as to the clusterability or linear separability of the data. It can help spot outliers, or can hint at the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. Moreover, it can sometimes reveal unexpected latent dimensions in the data. With all these uses, MDS is increasingly used in areas as diverse as marketing, medicine, genetics, music and linguistics. One of the strengths of MDS is that it is essentially agnostic to data type, as we can use any distance measure to create the distance matrix, which is the only required input to the MDS algorithm. In spite of this generality, we make the following claim. MDS is not (well) defined for an increasingly important data type, time series subsequences.

ENIR is designed to address the key limitation of IsoRegC which is the monotonicity assumption of the predictions. Similar to BBQ, the method post-processes the output of a binary classifier to obtain calibrated probabilities. Thus it can be used with many existing classification models to generate accurate probabilistic predictions. We demonstrate the performance of ENIR on synthetic and real datasets for commonly applied binary classification models. Experimental results show that the method outperforms several common binary classifier calibration methods. In particular on the real data, ENIR commonly performs statistically significantly better than the other methods, and never worse.

As one would expect, just as opinions diverge among different reviewers, answers to such questions may also be subjective, opinionated, and divergent. This means that answering such questions automatically is quite different from traditional QA tasks, where it is assumed that a single 'correct' answer is available. While recent work introduced the idea of question-answering using product reviews, it did not account for two aspects that we consider in this paper: (1) Questions have multiple, often divergent, answers, and this full spectrum of answers should somehow be used to train the system, and (2) What makes a 'good' answer depends on the asker and the answerer, and these factors should be incorporated in order for the system to be more personalized.

In contrast to other forms of media, such as newspaper, the text in these social media posts usually contains fewer words, and is concentrated on a much narrower selection of topics. For these reasons, traditional LDA-based sentiment and topic modeling techniques generally do not work well in case of social media data. Another characteristic feature of this data is the use of special meta tokens, such as hashtags, which contain unique semantic meanings that are not captured by other ordinary words. In the recent years, many topic modeling techniques have been proposed for social media data, but the majority of this work does not take into account the specialty of tokens, such as hashtags, and treats them as ordinary words. In this paper, we propose probabilistic graphical models to address the problem of discovering latent topics and their sentiment from social media data, mainly microblogs like Twitter. We first propose MTM (Microblog Topic Model), a generative model that assumes each social media post generates from a single topic, and models both words and hashtags separately.

Node-based resilience measures optimize an objective based on a critical set of nodes whose removal causes some severity of disconnection in the network. Beyond presenting a general framework for the usage of node based resilience measures for variations of clustering problems, we emphasize the unique potential of such methods to accomplish the following properties: (i) clustering a graph in one step without knowing the number of clusters a priori, and (ii) removing noise from noisy data. We first present results of clustering experiments using a β-parametrized generalization of vertex attack tolerance, showing high clustering accuracy for both real datasets and equal density synthetic data sets, as well as successful removal of noise nodes. It is shown that arbitrarily increasing β increases the number of noise nodes removed in some cases, and that internal validation measures can be used to determine the correct number of clusters in a class of datasets. Further results are presented using five different resilience measures with a general node-based resilience clustering technique. In a subset of cases a resilience measure, such as integrity, is able to cluster to high accuracy in one step, giving the correct clustering while also determining the correct number of clusters. Integrity is also shown to be promising with respect to noise removal, removing up to 80% of noise on some datasets.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: k medians clusteringcanopy clustering algorithmcorrelation clusteringconstrained clusteringdata stream clusteringcure data clustering algorithmfuzzy clusteringclustering high dimensional datanoise measurementscatteringcluster analysispsychological resiliencetheoretical computer sciencedata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics
Randomized Response and Balanced Bloom Filters for Privacy Preserving Record Linkage,Rainer Schnell (University of Duisburg-Essen)Christian Borgs (University of Duisburg-Essen),"2250090818,2540532416","In most European settings, record linkage across different institutions is based on encrypted personal identifiers - such as names, birthdays, or places of birth - to protect privacy. However, in practice up to 20% of the records may contain errors in identifiers. Thus, exact record linkage on encrypted identifiers usually results in the loss of large subsets of the data. Such losses usually imply biased statistical estimates since the causes of errors might be correlated with the variables of interest in many applications. Over the past 10 years, the field of Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) has developed different techniques to link data without revealing the identity of the described entity. However, only few techniques are suitable for applied research with large data bases that include millions of records, which is typical for administrative or medical data bases. Bloom filters were found to be one successful technique for PPRL when large scale applications are concerned. Yet, Bloom filters have been subject to cryptographic attacks. Previous research has shown that the straight application of Bloom filters has a non-zero re-identification risk.

PPRL approaches are increasingly required in many real-world application areas ranging from healthcare to national security.

In domains like clothing recommendation, this task is particularly challenging since a successful system should be capable of handling a large corpus of items, a huge amount of relationships among them, as well as the high-dimensional and semantically complicated features involved. Furthermore, the human notion of ""compatibility"" to capture goes beyond mere similarity: For two items to be compatible—whether jeans and a t-shirt, or a laptop and a charger—they should be similar in some ways, but systematically different in others.

Little work has been done on this challenge.

CUFS quantifies the outlierness (or relevance) of features by learning and integrating both the feature value couplings and feature couplings. Such value-to-feature couplings capture intrinsic data characteristics and distinguish relevant features from those noisy/redundant features. CUFS is further instantiated into a parameter-free Dense Subgraph-based Feature Selection method, called DSFS. We prove that DSFS retains a 2-approximation feature subset to the optimal subset. Extensive evaluation results on 15 real-world data sets show that DSFS obtains an average 48% feature reduction rate, and enables three different types of pattern-based outlier detection methods to achieve substantially better AUC improvements and/or perform orders of magnitude faster than on the original feature set.

Matrix Factorization and Markov Chain methods have emerged as two separate but powerful paradigms for modeling the two respectively. Combining these ideas has led to unified methods that accommodate long-and short-term dynamics simultaneously by modeling pairwise user-item and item-item interactions.

Normally, matrix completion considers a single matrix, which can be a noisy image or a rating matrix in recommendation. In practice however, data is often obtained from multiple domains rather than a single domain. For example, in recommendation, multiple matrices may exist as user x movie and user x book, while correlations among the multiple domains can be reasonably exploited to improve the quality of matrix completion. In this paper, we consider the problem of aligned matrix completion, where multiple matrices are recovered that correspond to different representations of the same group of objects. In the proposed model, we maintain consistency of multiple domains with a shared latent structure, while allowing independent patterns for each separate domain. In addition, we impose the low-rank structure of a matrix with a novel regularizer which provides better approximation than the standard nuclear norm relaxation.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: document term matrixeight point algorithmdistance matrixnoise measurementcorrelationconvergencealgorithm designtheoretical computer sciencedata miningmathematical optimizationcomputer sciencemathematics

In this paper, we propose the use of quantile analysis to obtain local scale estimates for neighborhood graph construction. To this end, we build an auto-encoding neural network approach for inferring conditional quantiles of a similarity function, which are subsequently used to obtain robust estimates of the local scales.

In such applications, it is quite often the case that the event of interest may not always be observed during the study period and this gives rise to the problem of censoring which cannot be easily handled in the standard regression approaches. In addition, obtaining sufficient labeled training instances for learning a robust prediction model is a very time consuming process and can be extremely difficult in practice. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning based Cox method, called Transfer-Cox, which uses auxiliary data to augment learning when there are insufficient amount of training examples. The proposed method aims to extract ""useful"" knowledge from the source domain and transfer it to the target domain, thus potentially improving the prediction performance in such time-to-event data. The proposed method uses the l_2,1-norm penalty to encourage multiple predictors to share similar sparsity patterns, thus learns a shared representation across source and target domains, potentially improving the model performance on the target task. To speedup the computation, we apply the screening approach and extend the strong rule to sparse survival analysis models in multiple high-dimensional censored datasets. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed transfer learning method using several synthetic and high-dimensional microarray gene expression benchmark datasets and compare with other related competing state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that the proposed screening approach significantly improves the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm without compromising the prediction performance.

Will this yield lower reconstruction errors? Is it easy to find a low-rank matrix that rounds to a given binary matrix? Does it matter which threshold we use for rounding?

Third, geographical constraints of neighbor locations are not taken into account. To address these challenges, we propose a regularized content-aware tensor factorization (RCTF) algorithm, which exploits three strategies to address the corresponding challenges.

Given the sheer size and restricted access of online social network data, efficient computation of subgraph counts is highly challenging. Although a number of algorithms have been proposed to estimate the relative counts of subgraphs in OSNs with restricted access, there are only few works which try to solve a more general problem, i.e., counting subgraph frequencies. In this paper, we propose an efficient random walk-based framework to estimate the subgraph counts. Our framework generates samples by leveraging consecutive steps of the random walk as well as by observing neighbors of visited nodes. Using the importance sampling technique, we derive unbiased estimators of the subgraph counts. To make better use of the degree information of visited nodes, we also design an improved estimator, which increases the efficiency of the estimate at no additional cost. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation on real-world OSNs to confirm our theoretical claims. The experiment results show that our estimators are unbiased, accurate, efficient and better than the state-of-the-art algorithm.

Gaussian Component Based Index for GMMs,Linfei Zhou (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich)Bianca Wackersreuther (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich)Frank Fiedler (University of Mainz)Claudia Plant (Florida State University)Christian Bohm (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich),"2565336067,160997069,2531866330,2122910652,2486446532","Efficient similarity search for uncertain data is a challenging task in many modern data mining applications like image retrieval, speaker recognition and stock market analysis. A common way to model the uncertainty of data objects is using probability density functions in the form of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which have an ability to approximate arbitrary distribution. However, due to the possible unequal length of mixture models, the use of existing index techniques has serious problems for the objects modeled by GMMs. Either the techniques cannot handle GMMs or they have too many limitations. Hence, we propose a dynamic index structure, Gaussian Component based Index (GCI), for GMMs. GCI decomposes GMMs into the single, pairs, or n-lets of Gaussian components, stores these components into well studied index trees such as U-tree and Gauss-Tree, and refines the corresponding GMMs in a conservative but tight way. GCI supports both k-most-likely queries and probability threshold queries by means of Matching Probability. Extensive experimental evaluations of GCI demonstrate a considerable speed-up of similarity search on both synthetic and real-world data sets.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: mixture modeldata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Yet, a scalable algorithm to find such most interesting patterns is lacking. We introduce a new algorithm based on two notions: (1) the use of Constraint Programming, which results in a notably shorter development time, faster runtimes, and more flexibility for extensions such as branch-and-bound search, and (2), the direct search for the most interesting patterns only, instead of exhaustive enumeration of patterns before ranking them. Through empirical evaluation, we find that our novel bounds yield speedups up to several orders of magnitude, especially on dense data with a simple schema.

While there has been significant progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of DTW in recent years, in this work we demonstrate that an underappreciated issue can significantly degrade the accuracy of DTW in real-world deployments. This issue has probably escaped the attention of the very active time series research community because of its reliance on static highly contrived benchmark datasets, rather than real world dynamic datasets where the problem tends to manifest itself. In essence, the issue is that DTW's eponymous invariance to warping is only true for the main ""body"" of the two time series being compared. However, for the ""head"" and ""tail"" of the time series, the DTW algorithm affords no warping invariance. The effect of this is that tiny differences at the beginning or end of the time series (which may be either consequential or simply the result of poor ""cropping"") will tend to contribute disproportionally to the estimated similarity, producing incorrect classifications. In this work, we show that this effect is real, and reduces the performance of the algorithm. We further show that we can fix the issue with a subtle redesign of the DTW algorithm, and that we can learn an appropriate setting for the extra parameter we introduced. We further demonstrate that our generalization is amiable to all the optimizations that make DTW tractable for large datasets.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: dynamic time warpingtimetime seriesstatistical classificationspeech recognitiondata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

Interestingly, for a long time closing this gap even using 2 passes over an adversarial stream was open until very recently that Konrad, Magniez, and Mathieu in [5] made progress toward answering this question.We develop a 0:583-approximation 2-pass streaming algorithm to find the maximum matching in bipartite graphs, using O(n) space. Using the same technique we give a 0:605-approximation 3-pass streaming algorithm to find the maximum matching in bipartite graphs, using O(n) space.

Our 3-pass algorithm is the first 3-pass streaming algorithm that achieves an approximation factor better than 0:6.In the first pass of our algorithm we find a maximal matching M. In the second pass, for every unmatched vertex we keep a small number of edges (so-called, golden edges) incident to distinct matched vertices in M. Every matched vertex of M is incident to at most one golden edge. At the end of second pass, we invoke an optimal matching algorithm on the union of matched and golden edges. For the analysis, let M be a maximum cardinality matching of G. We show that golden edges help to find a good fraction of augmenting paths of length 3 inM[M and also they build many new augmenting paths of length 3 using augmenting paths of length at least 5 and other alternating paths of M [ M.

Spatio-Temporal Site Recommendation,Guolei YangAndreas Zufle (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich),"2674606347,79808299","Recommendation systems have become extremely common in recent years, and are utilized in a variety of areas to predict the ""rating"" or ""preference"" that a user would give to a point of interest (PoI), such as a restaurant, a hotel, or a bar. Such systems typically produce a list of recommendations by considering previous ratings of the user, as well as ratings of other users. Not every person rates every point of interest they visit. In this work, we want to explore the use of spatio-temporal data to improve recommendation systems: We postulate that spatio-temporal user data may indicate the liking or disliking of a point of interest. Clearly, if a user frequently visits the same PoI, stays at the PoI for long times, and is willing to travel a long distance to visit a PoI, that might indicate that user likes that PoI. Thus, we propose to extract user-PoI relation features from spatio-temporal trajectory data only. Using these features, we use out-of-the-box data mining and machine learning solutions, to estimate the popularity of a PoI. Our experimental evaluation shows, that the features extracted from spatio-temporal data able to accurately predict the popularity of a PoI, using ground-truth data from FourSquare as a baseline.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: world wide webdata miningcomputer science

Given a series of snapshots of a temporal heterogeneous graph, we aim to find interesting projections of the graph which have anomalous evolutionary behavior. Detecting anomalous projections in a series of such snapshots can be helpful for an analyst to understand the regions of interest from the temporal graph. Identifying such semantically related regions in the graph allows the analyst to derive insights from temporal graphs which enables her in making decisions. While most of the work on temporal outlier detection is performed on nodes, subgraphs and communities, we are the first to propose detection of evolutionary graph cuboid outliers. Further, we perform this detection in a query sensitive manner. Thus, an evolutionary graph cuboid outlier is a projection (or cuboid) of a snapshot of the temporal graph such that it contains an unexpected number of matches for the query with respect to other cuboids both in the same snapshot as well as in the other snapshots. Identifying such outliers is challenging because (1) the number of cuboids per snapshot could be large, and (2) number of snapshots could itself be large. We model the problem by predicting the outlier score for each cuboid in each snapshot. We propose to build subspace ensemble regression models to learn (a) the behavior of a cuboid across different snapshots, and (b) the behavior of all the cuboids in a given snapshot.

Automated analysis is necessary to deal with the large volumes of tweets in a timely manner, and an insightful classification is a first step in this analysis. This paper presents an ensemble method that combines classifier outputs by including the individual probability distributions with an additional learning layer, as opposed to an arithmetic combination of weighted probabilities. Besides using probabilities generated by individual classifiers, we also show that the use of tweet vectors helps with the ensemble learning step. In addition, we have described a mapping method to employ a cloud taxonomy service as an additional classifier. We include LLDA, Naive Bayes, and the cloud taxonomy service for the ensemble method, and have applied our methods on a real industry tweet dataset. The proposed ensemble model is able to outperform several widely used probability based ensemble methods, i.e., Weighted Sum and Product of Experts (PoE).

Inferring Variable Labels Considering Co-occurrence of Variable Labels in Data Jackets,Teruaki Hayashi (University of Tokyo),2154577981,"Data Jacket (DJ) is a technique for sharing information about data and for considering the potential value of datasets, allowing data itself hidden, by describing the summary of data in natural language. In DJs, variables in datasets are described as variable labels (VLs), which is the name/meaning of variables. In the context of data utilization and exchange, the utility of data can be discussed upon the VLs to consider the combination of data stored in different domains. However, due to the lack of VLs in some DJs, DJs essentially related to each other cannot be formed to have linkage through string matching of VLs, which makes it difficult to think of feasible plans of data analyses and combinations. In this paper, we propose a method for inferring VLs in DJs whose VLs are missing or unknown, using the content of the outlines of DJs written in free texts. Specifically, we focus on the co-occurrence of VLs in DJs. The co-occurrence of VLs is a feature that there may be a highly frequent pair of VLs appearing at the same time, e.g., ""year"" and ""day"", or ""name"" and ""gender"". By focusing on the co-occurrence of VLs and the similarity of the outlines of data in training data of DJs, we demonstrate that our proposed method works significantly better than the method introducing only the similarity of outlines of datasets.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: stakeholdertraining setinformation privacydata scienceworld wide webdata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer science
Topic Extraction Method from Millions of Tweets Based on Fast Feature Selection Technique CWC,"Takako Hashimoto (Chiba University of Commerce)Dave Shepard (University of California, Los Angeles)Tetsuji Kuboyama (Gakushuin University)Kilho Shin (University of Tokyo)","2159281985,2223292679,2022906189,2591283321","Social media offers a wealth of insight into how significant topics such as the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Arab Spring, and the Boston Bombing affect individuals. The scale of available data, however, can be intimidating: during the Great East Japan Earthquake, over 8 million tweets were sent each day from Japan alone. Conventional word vector-based topic-detection techniques for social media that use Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or graph community detection often cannot scale to such a large volume of data due to their space and time complexity. To alleviate this problem, we have already proposed an efficient method for topic extraction by leveraging our original fast feature selection algorithm, CWC, which vastly reduces the number of features to track. While we begin with word count vectors of authors and words for each time slot (in our case, every 30 minutes), we make clusters from each time slot by a matrix decomposition technique to identify clusters and adapt CWC to extract discriminative words from each cluster. This method makes it possible to detect topics from high dimensional datasets. In this paper, to demonstrate our method's effectiveness, we extract topics from a dataset of over two hundred million tweets sent following the Great East Japan Earthquake and compare them with the result extracted by LDA, the current most popular topic extraction method.

Similarity Tree Pruning: A Novel Dynamic Ensemble Selection Approach,Anil Narassiguin (Centre national de la recherche scientifique)Haytham Elghazel (University of Lyon)Alex Aussem (University of Lyon),"2398051742,2291370321,1210402752","Dynamic ensemble selection (or dynamic pruning) is a learning paradigm that reduces the size of an ensemble of classifiers for each test pattern as input. The purpose of this approach is to improve the performances of the ensemble method by eliminating dynamically all the weak learners for a specific input. As of now, most of the dynamic pruning methods use information about the validation data and intermediate performances of the ensemble's classifiers on it, but none of them take the advantage of the intrinsic information given by those classifiers. In this paper we propose a new dynamic ensemble selection framework based on a tree internal supervised measure. This implies that our approach works on homogeneous ensemble methods with trees as base learners. This approach is motivated by the fact that in high dimensional datasets, usual metrics like euclidean distance suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, a similarity measure based on decision tree structure can be considered as supervised, which is well suited for supervised learning. Our framework is called ST-DES for Similarity Tree Dynamic Ensemble Selection. In this work, we use one of the best ensemble algorithm, Random Forest, as the base ensemble generator. We then compare the performance in terms of accuracy of ST-DES against the best known approaches in literature on different UCI datasets.

The classical trial-error methods are exponentially expensive in large parameter spaces, and Bayesian optimization (BO) offers an elegant alternative for global optimization of black box functions. In situations where the functions can be evaluated at multiple points simultaneously, batch Bayesian optimization is used. Current batch BO approaches are restrictive in fixing the number of evaluations per batch, and this can be wasteful when the number of specified evaluations is larger than the number of real maxima in the underlying acquisition function. We present the budgeted batch Bayesian optimization (B3O) for hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design - we identify the appropriate batch size for each iteration in an elegant way. In particular, we use the infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) for automatically identifying the number of peaks in the underlying acquisition functions. We solve the intractability of estimating the IGMM directly from the acquisition function by formulating the batch generalized slice sampling to efficiently draw samples from the acquisition function.

Existing models of information sharing among agents enforce an obligation to provide information upon request.

To further incorporate real-world settings, information sharing happens only by request. Our work explores agent behaviors in this environment and the ability of sellers to gain utility.

However, training large networks still remains a challenge, as the training data may be insufficient and the model can easily get overfitted.

Typical regularizers include weight decay, Dropout, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel regularizer, named Structured Decorrelation Constraint (SDC), which is applied to the activations of the hidden layers to prevent overfitting and achieve better generalization. SDC impels the network to learn structured representations by grouping the hidden units and encouraging the units within the same group to have strong connections during the training procedure. Meanwhile, it forces the units in different groups to learn non-redundant representations by minimizing the cross-covariance between them. Compared with Dropout, SDC reduces the co-adaptions between the hidden units in an explicit way. Besides, we propose a novel approach called Reg-Conv that can help SDC to regularize the complex convolutional layers.

In many applications of graph analysis like network analysis or medical information extraction we are searching for special patterns. Here, it is not sufficient to extract only parts of the relevant information in a graph, but to understand the complete underlying structure. Therefore, we propose our algorithm MeGS (Partitioning Meaningful Subgraph Structures using Minimum Description Length) to fully understand how a graph is constructed. The most common primitives (clique, hub, tree, bipartite, and sparse) serve as models to split a graph into meaningful structures. Using the principle of Minimum Description Length (MDL) structure types and counts are determined by the best fitting model. These structures achieve the best compression of the adjacency matrix. As result, every node is part of exactly one structure and has an interpretable context. No unknown areas remain in the graph. The higher a model compresses its section of the graph, the stronger its match with the corresponding structural assumption.

However, the extracted topics by ITA are different from the topic a user requests. In the case of service to the people, interactive system for reflecting the user requests is necessary. We cover the user requests as follows. For example, it is assumed resultant three topics, topic A and topic B and topic C. If a user thought to be close a content of the topic A and topic B, a user wants to merge the topic A and topic B as one of the topic D. In addition, if a user wanted to analyze topic A in more detail, a user would like to separate topic A to topic E and topic F. In that case, it is necessary to incorporate these requests to the ITA. To that end, we define the Merge Link constraints and Separate Link constraints as the user requests. Merge Link constraints is a constraint that merges two topics into one topic. Separate Link constraint is a constraint that separates two topics from one topic. In this paper, we propose a method of extracting a highly independent topic that meets these constraints. We conducted evaluation experiments on proposed methods, and obtained results to show the effectiveness of our approach.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: matrix decompositioncorrelationdocument clusteringworld wide webinformation retrievaldata miningcomputer sciencemathematics

Aproper patient similarity measure enables various downstreamapplications, such as cohort study and treatment comparative effectiveness research. One major carrier for conductingpatient similarity research is the Electronic Health Records(EHRs), which are usually heterogeneous, longitudinal, andsparse. Though existing studies on learning patient similarityfrom EHRs have shown being useful in solving real clinicalproblems, their applicability is limited due to the lack of medicalinterpretations. Moreover, most previous methods assume avector based representation for patients, which typically requiresaggregation of medical events over a certain time period. As aconsequence, the temporal information will be lost. In this paper, we propose a patient similarity evaluation framework based ontemporal matching of longitudinal patient EHRs. Two efficientmethods are presented, unsupervised and supervised, both ofwhich preserve the temporal properties in EHRs.

Such data includes microblogging platforms such as Twitter, social networks such as Facebook, and data from news stations. Such geo-textual data allows to immediately detect and react to new and emerging trends. A trend is a set of keywords associated with a time interval where the frequency of these keywords is increased significantly. In this paper, we investigate the dissemination of trends over space and time. For this purpose, we employ a four-step framework. In the first step, we employ existing solutions to mine a large number of trends. Second, for each trend we create a spatio-temporal dissemination model, which describes the motion of this trend over space and time. To model this dissemination, we employ a (flow-source, flow-destination, time, trend) tensor. In the third step, we cluster these trend-tensors, to identify groups of archetype trends. For each archetype, we aggregate all tensors of the same archetype, and employ a tensor factorization approach to describe this archetype by its latent features. As the fourth step, we propose an algorithm which can classify the trend-archetype of a new trend, in order to predict the future dissemination of this trend.

One practical challenge to build such an Android is to ask correct questions and obtain most relevant information, in order to correctly pinpoint the most likely causes of health conditions. In this paper, we tackle this challenge, named ""relevant symptom question generation"": Given a limited set of patient described symptoms in the initial question (e.g., ""stomach ache""), what are the most critical symptoms to further ask the patient, in order to correctly diagnose their potential problems? We propose an augmented long short-term memory (LSTM) framework, where the network architecture can naturally incorporate the inputs from embedding vectors of patient described symptoms and an initial disease hypothesis given by a predictive model. Then the proposed framework generates the most important symptom questions. The generation process essentially models the conditional probability to observe a new and undisclosed symptom, given a set of symptoms from a patient as well as an initial disease hypothesis.

Such approaches are useful in ensuring adherence to laws and regulations, fair treatment of content providers, and exclusion of unwanted information. For example, recommendations that match an employer with a job applicant should not be based on socially sensitive information, such as gender or race, from the perspective of social fairness. An algorithm that could exclude the influence of such sensitive information would be useful in this case. We previously gave a formal definition of recommendation independence and proposed a method adopting a regularizer that imposes such an independence constraint. As no other options than this regularization approach have been put forward, we here propose a new model-based approach, which is based on a generative model that satisfies the constraint of recommendation independence. We apply this approach to a latent class model and empirically show that the model-based approach can enhance recommendation independence. Recommendation algorithms based on generative models, such as topic models, are important, because they have a flexible functionality that enables them to incorporate a wide variety of information types. Our new model-based approach will broaden the applications of independence-enhanced recommendation by integrating the functionality of generative models.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingpredictive modellingrandom variablelinear programmingknowledge managementdata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningstatisticscomputer science

However, in its original formulation DTW is extremely inefficient in comparing long sparse time series, containing mostly zeros and some unevenly spaced non-zero observations. Original DTW distance does not take advantage of this sparsity, leading to redundant calculations and a prohibitively large computational cost for long time series. We derive a new time warping similarity measure (AWarp) for sparse time series that works on the run-length encoded representation of sparse time series. The complexity of AWarp is quadratic on the number of observations as opposed to the range of time of the time series. Therefore, AWarp can be several orders of magnitude faster than DTW on sparse time series. AWarp is exact for binary-valued time series and a close approximation of the original DTW distance for any-valued series. We discuss useful variants of AWarp: bounded (both upper and lower), constrained, and multidimensional. We show applications of AWarp to three data mining tasks including clustering, classification, and outlier detection, which are otherwise not feasible using classic DTW, while producing equivalent results.

Current active learning strategies are designed from human knowledge, and are applied on each dataset in an immutable manner. In other words, experience about the usefulness of strategies cannot be updated and transferred to improve active learning on other datasets. This paper initiates a pioneering study on whether active learning experience can be transferred. We first propose a novel active learning model that linearly aggregates existing strategies. The linear weights can then be used to represent the active learning experience. We equip the model with the popular linear upper-confidence-bound (LinUCB) algorithm for contextual bandit to update the weights. Finally, we extend our model to transfer the experience across datasets with the technique of biased regularization.

Relationships between nodes in a signed network are represented as positive (trust) or negative (distrust) edges. Many social networks have adopted signed networks to express trust between users. Consequently, ranking friends or enemies in signed networks has received much attention from the data mining community. The ranking problem, however, is challenging because it is difficult to interpret negative edges. Traditional random walk based methods such as PageRank and Random Walk with Restart cannot provide effective rankings in signed networks since they assume only positive edges. Although several methods have been proposed by modifying traditional ranking models, they also fail to account for proper rankings due to the lack of ability to consider complex edge relations. In this paper, we propose Signed Random Walk with Restart, a novel model for personalized ranking in signed networks. We introduce a signed random surfer so that she considers negative edges by changing her sign for walking. Our model provides proper rankings reflecting signed edges based on the signed surfer.

As an example, a comparison of different genomes could throw light on causes for different diseases. Human variabilities happen due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Thus it might suffice to focus on these SNPs while comparing different genomes. One of the important problems in GWAS is that of identifying the correlation between genotypes (SNPs for example) and phenotypes (i.e., different characteristics such as addiction, the presence of cancer, etc.) Different approaches exist for addressing this problem. One important approach is via modeling this problem as the k-locus problem (k being any integer). The case of k = 1 has been studied widely. Some algorithms also exist for solving the case of k = 2.

We present three scoring models and show that, through empirical evaluation using real-world, large-scale data, by incorporating the potential value of a user to an advertiser into our scoring model, we can significantly improve the performance of the look-alike models over methods which only use pairwise similarities of users.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingcontext modelcomputational modelapproximation algorithmdata scienceworld wide webdata miningmachine learningcomputer science

Therefore, ad agencies have to know the properties and topics of each website in order to optimize advertising submission strategy. However, since website content is in natural languages, they have to convert these qualitative sentences into quantitative data if they want to classify websites using statistical models. To address this issue, this study applies statistical analysis to website information written in natural languages. We apply a dictionary of neologisms in order to decompose website sentences into words and create a dataset of 0, 1 indicator matrices to classify the websites.

Towards Scalable Network Delay Minimization,"Sourav MedyaPetko Bogdanov (University of California, Santa Barbara)Ambuj K. Singh (University of California, Santa Barbara)","2342828630,2247548115,2099219664","Reduction of end-to-end network delays is an optimization task with applications in multiple domains. Low delays enable improved information flow in social networks, quick spread of ideas in collaboration networks, low travel times for vehicles on road networks and increased rate of packets in communication networks. Delay reduction can be achieved by both improving the propagation capabilities of individual nodes and adding additional edges in the network. One of the main challenges in such design problems is that the effects of local changes are not independent, and as a consequence, there is a combinatorial search space of possible improvements. Thus, minimizing the cumulative propagation delay requires novel scalable and data-driven approaches. In this paper, we consider the problem of network delay minimization via node upgrades. Although the problem is NP-hard, we show that probabilistic approximation for a restricted version can be obtained.

A Novel Uncertainty Sampling Algorithm for Cost-Sensitive Multiclass Active Learning,Kuan-Hao Huang (National Taiwan University)Hsuan-Tien Lin (National Taiwan University),"2113276713,2127632057","Active learning is a setup that allows the learning algorithm to iteratively and strategically query the labels of some instances for reducing human labeling efforts. One fundamental strategy, called uncertainty sampling, measures the uncertainty of each instance when making querying decisions. Traditional active learning algorithms focus on binary or multiclass classification, but few works have studied active learning for cost-sensitive multiclass classification (CSMCC), which allows charging different costs for different types of misclassification errors. The few works are generally based on calculating the uncertainty of each instance by probability estimation, and can suffer from the inaccuracy of the estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm that relies on a different way of calculating the uncertainty. The algorithm is based on our newly-proposed cost embedding approach (CE) for CSMCC. CE embeds the cost information in the distance measure of a special hidden space with non-metric multidimensional scaling, and deals with both symmetric and asymmetric cost information by our carefully designed mirroring trick. The embedding allows the proposed algorithm, active learning with cost embedding (ALCE), to define a cost-sensitive uncertainty measure from the distance in the hidden space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ALCE selects more useful instances by taking the cost information into account through the embedding and is superior to existing cost-sensitive active learning algorithms.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: measurement uncertaintysymmetric matrixpredictionalgorithm designuncertaintyestimationactive learningdata miningmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticsmathematics

Typically, analysts do not simply posit a particular form of the regression model, estimate its parameters, and use the results for inference orprediction. Instead, they first use a variety of diagnostic techniques to assess how well the model fits the relationships in the data and how well it can be expected to predict outcomes for out-of-sample records, revising the model as necessary to improve fit and predictive power. In this article, we develop e-differentially private diagnostics for regression, beginning to fill a gap in privacy-preserving data analysis. Specifically, we create differentially private versions of residual plots for linear regression and of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for logistic regression. The former helps determine whether or not the data satisfy the assumptions underlying the linear regression model, and the latter is used to assess the predictive power of the logistic regression model. These diagnostics improve the usefulness of algorithms for computing differentially private regression output, which alone does not allow analysts to assess the quality of the posited model.

However, the crucial drawback with cut trees is the computational cost of their construction. In theory, a cut tree is built by applying a maximum flow algorithm for n times, where n is the number of vertices. Therefore, naive implementations of this approach result in cubic time complexity, which is obviously too slow for today's large-scale graphs.

Feature representations of graphs are usually found by mining discriminative sub-graph patterns that are non-uniformly distributed across class labels. However, as these feature selection approaches are computationally expensive for multiple labels, prior knowledge about label correlations should be exploited as much as possible. In this work, we introduce a new approach for mining discriminative sub-graph patterns with constraints that are extracted from links between labels in knowledge graphs which indicate label correlations. The incorporation of these constraints allows to prune the search space and ensures extraction of consistent patterns. Therefore, constraint checking remains efficient and more robust classification results can be obtained. We evaluate our approach on both, one public and one custom simulated data set.

We first introduce a framework of probabilistic modeling of CNMF and reduce this issue to statistical model selection. The problem is here that conventional model selection criteria such as AIC, BIC, MDL cannot straightforwardly be applied since the probabilistic model for CNMF is irregular in the sense that parameters are not uniquely identifiable. We overcome this problem to propose a novel criterion for best structure selection for CNMF.

These multi-view data contain much more information to uncover the cluster structure than single-view data, which draws raising attention in data mining and machine learning areas. On one hand, many features are extracted to provide enough information for better representations, on the other hand, such abundant features might result in noisy, redundant and irrelevant information, which harms the performance of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we focus on a new topic, multi-view unsupervised feature selection, which aims to discover the discriminative features in each view for better explanation and representation. Although there are some exploratory studies along this direction, most of them employ the traditional feature selection by putting the features in different views together and fail to evaluate the performance in the multi-view setting. The features selected in this way are difficult to explain due to the meaning of different views, which disobeys the goal of feature selection as well. In light of this, we intend to give a correct understanding of multi-view feature selection. Different from the existing work, which either incorrectly concatenates the features from different views, or takes huge time complexity to learn the pseudo labels, we propose a novel algorithm, Robust Multi-view Feature Selection (RMFS), which applies robust multi-view K-means to obtain the robust and high quality pseudo labels for sparse feature selection in an efficient way. Nontrivially we give the solution by taking the derivatives and further provide a K-means-like optimization to update several variables in a unified framework with the convergence guarantee. We demonstrate extensive experiments on three real-world multi-view data sets, which illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RMFS in terms of both single-view and multi-view evaluations by a large margin.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: featurerobustnessfeature extractioncluster analysisalgorithm designdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

Method for Extraction of Purchase Behavior and Product Character Using Dynamic Topic Model,Mamoru Emoto (University of Tokyo),2283052578,"In this study, we focus on extraction of latent topic transition from POS data. POS analysis is conducted to obtain the frequent pattern of customer's behavior. The fundamental method for POS analysis is to conduct market basket analysis. By doing Market basket analysis, the sets of products that are often bought at the same time can be extracted. In market basket analysis, however, the effect of time series is not considered. We conducted the experiment based on two hypotheses. One is that each product has several topics. The other is that the proportion of each product on a topic changes as the period changes. To extract topics and their changes, we use Dynamic Topic Model (DTM), which is an extended model of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Then we obtain the change of the topic-word distribution on each topic. Different topic has different characters, but it seems that there is a relationship between each topic. Therefore, we conduct correlation analysis to several items. From the result of visualization of product features vector of several items, we can obtain that each product has unique time-series change of product feature. This study is also conducted to reveal product features vector based on Customer Purchase Behavior. By using DTM, each basket is transformed into probability distribution vector, and we use this topic vectors as each basket's evaluation result of topic features. We divide POS data into 12 groups by purchasing time and create a heat map that indicates changes of topic proportion as time advances. By conducting this analysis, we can grasp customer behavior based on the topic vector space.

Waddling Random Walk: Fast and Accurate Mining of Motif Statistics in Large Graphs,Guyue HanHarish Sethu (Drexel University),"2679936574,1244039458","Algorithms for mining very large graphs, such as those representing online social networks, to discover the relative frequency of small subgraphs within them are of high interest to sociologists, computer scientists and marketeers alike. However, the computation of these network motif statistics via naive enumeration is infeasible for either its prohibitive computational costs or access restrictions on the full graph data. Methods to estimate the motif statistics based on random walks by sampling only a small fraction of the subgraphs in the large graph address both of these challenges. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, called the Waddling Random Walk (WRW), which estimates the concentration of motifs of any size. It derives its name from the fact that it sways a little to the left and to the right, thus also sampling nodes not directly on the path of the random walk. The WRW algorithm achieves its computational efficiency by not trying to enumerate subgraphs around the random walk but instead using a randomized protocol to sample subgraphs in the neighborhood of the nodes visited by the walk. In addition, WRW achieves significantly higher accuracy (measured by the closeness of its estimate to the correct value) and higher precision (measured by the low variance in its estimations) than the current state-of-the-art algorithms for mining subgraph statistics.

Heterogeneous Representation Learning with Structured Sparsity Regularization,Pei Yang (Arizona State University)Jingrui He,"2705969941,2712973463","Motivated by real applications, heterogeneous learning has emerged as an important research area, which aims to model the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a HEterogeneous REpresentation learning model with structured Sparsity regularization (HERES) to learn from multiple types of heterogeneity. HERES aims to leverage two kinds of information to build a robust learning system. One is the rich correlations among heterogeneous data such as task relatedness, view consistency, and label correlation. The other is the prior knowledge of the data in the form of, e.g., the soft-clustering of the tasks. HERES is a generic framework for heterogeneous learning, which integrates multi-task, multi-view, and multi-label learning into a principled framework based on representation learning. The objective of HERES is to minimize the reconstruction loss of using the factor matrices to recover the input matrix for heterogeneous data, regularized by the structured sparsity constraint. The resulting optimization problem is challenging due to the non-smoothness and non-separability of structured sparsity. We develop an iterative updating method to solve the problem. Furthermore, we prove that the reformulation of structured sparsity is separable, which leads to a family of efficient and scalable algorithms for solving structured sparsity penalized problems.

Intuition about clustering reflects the ideal case – exact data sets endowed with flawless dissimilarity between individual instances. In practice however, these cases are in the minority, and clustering applications are typically characterized by noisy data sets with approximate pairwise dissimilarities. As such, the efficacy of clustering methods necessitates robustness to perturbations. In this paper, we address foundational questions on perturbation robustness, studying to what extent can clustering techniques exhibit this desirable characteristic. Our results also demonstrate the type of cluster structures required for robustness of popular clustering paradigms.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: flame clusteringbrown clusteringcanopy clustering algorithmdetermining the number of clusters in a data setdbscancorrelation clusteringconstrained clusteringdata stream clusteringcure data clustering algorithmaffinity propagationfuzzy clusteringhamming distanceclustering high dimensional datafood additivehierarchical clusteringrobustnesscluster analysisalgorithm designconsensus clusteringbiclusteringconceptual clusteringstatistical classificationtheoretical computer sciencedata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Forexample, for the ECG signals collected by wearable devices, most of them collected from healthy people are normal, andonly a small number of them collected from people with certain heart diseases are abnormal. Furthermore, even forthe abnormal temporal sequences, the abnormal patterns mayonly be present in a few time segments and are similar amongthemselves, forming a rare category of temporal patterns. Forexample, the ECG signal collected from an individual with acertain heart disease may be normal in most time segments, and abnormal in only a few time segments, exhibiting similarpatterns. What is even more challenging is that such raretemporal patterns are often non-separable from the normalones. Existing works on outlier detection for temporal datafocus on detecting either the abnormal sequences as a whole, orthe abnormal time segments directly, ignoring the relationshipbetween abnormal sequences and abnormal time segments.Moreover, the abnormal patterns are typically treated asisolated outliers instead of a rare category with self-similarity. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a bi-level(sequence-level/ segment-level) model for rare temporal patterndetection. It is based on an optimization frameworkthat fully exploits the bi-level structure in the data, i.e., therelationship between abnormal sequences and abnormal timesegments. Furthermore, it uses sequence-specific simple hiddenMarkov models to obtain segment-level labels, and leverages the similarity among abnormal time segments to estimate the model parameters. To solve the optimization framework, we propose the unsupervised algorithm BIRAD, and also thesemi-supervised version BIRAD-K which learns from a single labeled example. Experimental results on both synthetic andreal data sets demonstrate the performance of the proposedalgorithms from multiple aspects, outperforming state-of-the-arttechniques on both temporal outlier detection and rarecategory analysis.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: time serieshidden markov modeldata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

From a data analysis standpoint, there is significant utility to be gained by detecting and understanding changes in the data, such as physical activity recognition and content consumption behavior, or anomalies and faults in robots and sensors. However, because the data is unlabeled, it is challenging to visualize and understand in a way that produces interpretable insights, furthermore, the large volume of data imposes a scalability requirement. In the concept drift and stream mining literature, existing methods may focus on one or two, but rarely all three, of the aforementioned aspects: unlabeled data, interpretable output, scalability. Addressing this need, we propose ConTrack, an unsupervised method that tracks multiple evolving concepts in temporal data, and which is parallelized over a cluster of machines. To enhance interpretability, our method structures its output at a per-user (or actor) level, where users subscribe to one or more evolving concepts. Our method applies to problem settings (multiple concepts, unsupervised data, temporal data, user-oriented data) that cannot be handled by existing concept drift and stream mining methods, and outperforms popular unsupervised baselines from the wider Data Mining and Machine Learning literature.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingscalabilityalgorithm designactivity recognitiondata stream miningdata sciencedata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

An attractive characteristic of our approachis that it is based on optimizing a well-defined objective function, and thus, contrary to previous approaches, the role-discovery task can be studied with the tools of combinatorial optimization. We demonstrate that, when fixing the number of roles to be used, the proposed role-discovery problem is np-hard, while another (seemingly easier) version of the problem is np-hard to approximate. On the positive side, despite the recursive nature of our objective function, we can show that finding a perfect (zero-cost) role assignmentwith the minimum number of roles can be solved in polynomial time. We do this by connecting the zero-cost role assignment with the notion of equitable partition.

Most real-world networks, from biological to social ones, are known to have common structural properties. These properties allow us to model the growth processes of networks and to develop useful algorithms. One remarkable example is the fractality of networks, which suggests the self-similar organization of global network structure. To determine the fractality of a network, we need to solve the so-called box-covering problem, where preceding algorithms are not feasible for large-scale networks. The lack of an efficient algorithm prevents us from investigating the fractal nature of large-scale networks. To overcome this issue, we propose a new box-covering algorithm based on recently emerging sketching techniques. We theoretically show that it works in near-linear time with a guarantee of solution accuracy. In experiments, we have confirmed that the algorithm enables us to study the fractality of million-scale networks for the first time. We have observed that its outputs are sufficiently accurate and that its time and space requirements are orders of magnitude smaller than those of previous algorithms.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: greedy algorithmfractalalgorithm designapproximation algorithmtheoretical computer sciencecombinatoricsdata miningmachine learningmathematical optimizationalgorithmcomputer sciencemathematics
Flexible Similarity Search for Enriched Trajectories,Hideaki OhashiToshiyuki Shimizu (University of Tokyo)Masatoshi Yoshikawa (Kyoto University),"2653697060,2139847331,2307105024","In this study, we focus on a method of searching for similar trajectories. In most previous works on searching for similar trajectories, only raw trajectory data have been used. However, to obtain deeper insights, additional time-dependent trajectory features should be utilized depending on the search intent. For instance, to identify soccer players who have similar dribbling patterns, such additional features include the correlations between players' speeds and directions. In addition, when finding similar combination plays, the additional features include the team players' movements. In this paper, we develop a framework to flexibly search for similar trajectories associated with time-dependent features, called enriched trajectories. In this framework, weights, which represent the relative importance of each feature, can be flexibly input. Moreover, to facilitate fast searching, we propose a lower bounding measure of the DTW distance between enriched trajectories. We evaluate the effectiveness of the lower bounding measure using soccer data and synthetic data.

Multiscale Analysis of Supply Network at Central Region in Japan,Yi Zuo (Nagoya University)Yuya Kajikawa,"2699490716,2669510412","Over the past decades, efficient supply chain management is recognized as a key strategic technology and resource in firms' success. Recent studies have been increasingly conducted network analysis in the fields of supply chain management and supplier-customer relationships. It is crucial to analyze interactional relationships and topological characteristics between suppliers and customers in supply networks rather than in traditionally linear supply chains. For this purpose, we involve a real-world supply network at central region in Japan in this paper and investigate different network structures of suppliercustomer relationships using network analysis techniques from three different scales. Firstly from the macro-scale, the network analysis approach provides clarity concerning network feature such as average path length. This feature can estimate the efficiency of material flow in the supply network, which also reveals the cost how passed to the final customers. Secondly from the meso-scale, we apply a network clustering algorithm to detect communities from the whole supply network, which is separated into five main supplier-customer communities. We also mark for individual communities via cross-location and crossindustry, which reveals the different features to bridge different business communities. Finally from the micro-scale, we extract core firms of each community using node degree-prior based on location-specific and industry-specific. We estimate the robustness of supply network by sequential elimination choice strategy of these hubs, which can also deliver efficient and effective support to supply network design and management.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: service managementsupply chainmanufacturingmeasurementsupply chain management
Improved and Scalable Bradley-Terry Model for Collaborative Ranking,Jun HuPing Li,"2669332616,2658214974","In collaborative ranking, the Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely used for modeling pairwise user preferences. However, when this model is combined with matrix factorization on sparsely observed ratings, a challenging identifiability issue arises since the optimization will involve non-convex constraints. Besides, in some situations, fitting the Bradley-Terry model yields a numerical challenge as it may include an objective function that is unbounded from below. In this paper, we will discuss and develop a simple strategy to resolve these issues. Specifically, we propose an Improved-BT model by adding a penalty term, and we develop two parallel algorithms to make Improved-BT model scalable.

It can be further divided into explicit and implicit social network recommendation. The former assumes the existence of explicit social connections between users in addition to the rating data. The latter one assumes the availability of only the ratings but not the social connections between users since the explicit social information data may not necessarily be available and usually are binary decision values (e.g., whether two people are friends), while the strength of their relationships is missing. Most of the works in this field use only rating data to infer the latent social networks. They ignore the dynamic nature of users that the preferences of users drift over time distinctly. To this end, we propose a new Implicit Dynamic Social Recommendation (IDSR) model, which infers latent social network from cascade data. It can sufficiently mine the information contained in time by mining the cascade data and identify the dynamic changes in the users in time by using the latest updated social network to make recommendations.

Predicting rare cases of highly popular news is not a trivial task due to shortcomings of standard learning approaches and evaluation metrics. So far, the standard task of predicting the popularity of news items has been tackled by either of two distinct strategies related to the publication time of news. The first strategy, a priori, is focused on predicting the popularity of news upon their publication when related social feedback is unavailable. The second strategy, a posteriori, is focused on predicting the popularity of news using related social feedback. However, both strategies present shortcomings related to data availability and time of prediction.

As the number of EVs is expanding, there is a growing need for widely distributed, publicly accessible, EV charging facilities. The public EV Chargers (EVCs) are expected to be found and will be needed where there is on-street parking, at taxi stands, in parking lots at places of employment, hotels, airports, shopping centres, convenience shops, fast food restaurants, and coffee houses, etc. In this work, we aim to optimize the distribution of public EVCs across the city such that (i) the overall revenue generated by the EVCs is maximized, subject to (ii) the overall driver discomfort (e.g., queueing time) for EV charging is minimized. This is the first study on EVC distribution where EVCs are assumed to be installed in almost all regions across a city. The problem is formulated using a bilevel optimization model.

A recent experimental comparison of the leading TSC algorithms has demonstrated that one approach is significantly more accurate than all others over 85 datasets. That approach, the Flat Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (Flat-COTE), achieves superior accuracy through combining predictions of 35 individual classifiers built on four representations of the data into a flat hierarchy. Outside of TSC, deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) have seen a recent surge in popularity and are now state of the art in many fields. An obvious question is whether CNNs could be equally transformative in the field of TSC. To test this, we implement a common CNN structure and compare performance to Flat-COTE and a recently proposed time series-specific CNN implementation. We find that Flat-COTE is significantly more accurate than both deep learning approaches on 85 datasets. These results are impressive, but Flat-COTE is not without deficiencies. We improve the collective by adding new components and proposing a modular hierarchical structure with a probabilistic voting scheme that allows us to encapsulate the classifiers built on each transformation. We add two new modules representing dictionary and interval-based classifiers, and significantly improve upon the existing frequency domain classifiers with a novel spectral ensemble. The resulting classifier, the Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (HIVE-COTE) is significantly more accurate than Flat-COTE and represents a new state of the art for TSC.

Then we select a set of the valuable customers from candidate customers, which has the balanced maximization between the interest and the profit metrics.

Among all the issues, the task of Click-through rates (CTR) prediction plays a central role, as it may influence the ranking and pricing of online ads. To deal with this task, the Factorization Machines (FM) model is designed for better revealing proper combinations of basic features. However, the sparsity of ads transaction data, i.e., a large proportion of zero elements, may severely disturb the performance of FM models. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Factorization Machines (SFM) model, in which the Laplace distribution is introduced instead of traditional Gaussian distribution to model the parameters, as Laplace distribution could better fit the sparse data with higher ratio of zero elements. Along this line, it will be beneficial to select the most important features or conjunctions with the proposed SFM model. Furthermore, we develop a distributed implementation of our SFM model on Spark platform to support the prediction task on mass dataset in practice.

In this work, we use a machine learning approach to identify potential violent lone offenders based on their written communication. The aim of this work is to capture psychological warning behaviors in written text and identify texts written by violent lone offenders.

Learning Task Relational Structure for Multi-task Feature Learning,De Wang (University of Texas at Arlington)Feiping Nie (University of Texas at Arlington)Heng Huang (University of Texas at Arlington),"2147695980,2245267964,2137533801","In multi-task learning, it is paramount to discover the relational structure of tasks and utilize the learned task structure. Previous works have been using the low-rank latent feature subspace to capture the task relations, and some of them aim to learn the group based relational structure of tasks. However, in many cases, the low-rank subspace may not exist for the specific group of tasks, thus using this paradigm would not work. To discover the task relational structures, we propose a novel multi-task learning method using the structured sparsity-inducing norms to automatically uncover the relations of tasks. Instead of imposing the low-rank constraint, our new model uses a more meaningful assumption, in which the tasks from the same relational group should share the common feature subspace. We can discover the group relational structure of tasks and learn the shared feature subspace for each task group, which help to improve the predictive performance. Our proposed algorithm avoids the high computational complexity of integer programming, thus it converges very fast.

However, by using uniformly damping kernels, they are unable to handle irregularly shaped regions or capture land value discontinuities within the same region due to the existence of implicit sub-communities, which are common in real-world scenarios.

It can be used to resolve the problem of imperfect field alignment in a database or identify comparable fields for matching records from multiple sources. The annotation process is not trivial because data values may be noisy, such as abbreviations, variations or misspellings. In particular, overlapping features usually exist in a lexicon-based approach. In this work, we present a probabilistic address parser based on linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs), which allow more expressive token-level features compared to hidden Markov models (HMMs).

Another is post-processing of the output sequences of the parser by combining its conditional probability and a score function, which is based on a learned stochastic regular grammar (SRG) that captures segment-level dependencies. Experiments were conducted by comparing the CRF parser to a HMM parser and a semi-Markov CRF parser in two real-world datasets. The CRF parser out-performed the HMM parser and the semi-Markov CRF in both datasets in terms of classification accuracy.

Analyzing opinions with an associated sentiment is crucial to the success of any campaign (product, marketing, or political). However, there are two significant challenges that need to be overcome. First, social networks produce large volumes of data at high velocities. Using traditional (semi-) manual methods to gather training data is, therefore, impractical and expensive. Second, humans express more than two emotions, therefore, the typical binary good/bad or positive/negative classifiers are no longer sufficient to address the complex needs of the social marketing domain. This paper introduces a hugely scalable approach to gathering training data by using emojis as proxy for user sentiments. This paper also introduces a systematic Word2Vec based clustering method to generate emoji clusters that arguably represent different human emotions (multi-sentiment). Finally, this paper also introduces a threshold-based formulation to predicting one or two class labels (multi-label) for a given document. Our scalable multi-sentiment multi-label model produces a cross-validation accuracy of 71.55% (± 0.22%).

It is thus highly desirable to be able to directly optimize these performance measures on large-scale data. Recent advances have shown that this is possible in the simple binary classification setting. However, scant progress exists in multiclass settings with a large number of classes where, in addition, class-imbalance is much more severe. The lack of progress is especially conspicuous for the macro-averaged F-measure, which is the widely preferred F-measure variant in multiclass settings due to its equal emphasis on rare classes. Known methods of optimization scale poorly for macro F-measure, often requiring run times that are exponential in the number of classes. We develop BEAM-F, the first efficient method for directly optimizing the macro F-measure in multiclass settings.

Common applications range from product recommendation to social networks and protein interaction. One of the main inferences in this types of networks is the guilty-by-association method, where labeled nodes propagate their information throughout the network, towards unlabeled nodes. While there is a widely used algorithm for this context, called Belief Propagation, it lacks the necessary convergence guarantees for loopy-networks. More recently, a new alternative method was proposed, called LinBP and while it solved the convergence issue, the scalability for large graphs that do not fit memory remains a challenge. Additionally, most works that try to use BP considering large scale graphs rely on specific infrastructure such as supercomputers and computational clusters. Therefore we propose a new algorithm, that leverages state-of-the-art asynchronous vertex-centric parallel processing techniques in conjunction with the state-of-the-art BP alternative LinBP, to provide a scalable framework for large graph inference that runs on a single commodity machine.

The past decade has witnessed many successful applications of MTL in different domains. In the center of MTL algorithms is how the relatedness of tasks are modeled and encoded in learning formulations to facilitate knowledge transfer. Among the MTL algorithms, the multi-task relationship learning (MTRL) attracted much attention in the community because it learns task relationship from data to guide knowledge transfer, instead of imposing a prior task relatedness assumption. However, this method heavily depends on the quality of training data. When there is insufficient training data or the data is too noisy, the algorithm could learn an inaccurate task relationship that misleads the learning towards suboptimal models. To address the aforementioned challenge, in this paper we propose a novel interactive multi-task relationship learning (iMTRL) framework that efficiently solicits partial order knowledge of task relationship from human experts, effectively incorporates the knowledge in a proposed knowledge-aware MTRL formulation.

In document analysis, it hasbeen increasingly used in topic modeling applications, where aset of underlying topics are revealed by a low-rank factor matrixfrom NMF. However, it is often the case that the resulting topicsgive only general topic information in the data, which tends notto convey much information. To tackle this problem, we proposea novel ensemble model of nonnegative matrix factorizationfor discovering high-quality local topics. Our method leveragesthe idea of an ensemble model, which has been successfulin supervised learning, into an unsupervised topic modelingcontext. That is, our model successively performs NMF givena residual matrix obtained from previous stages and generatesa sequence of topic sets. Our algorithm for updating the inputmatrix has novelty in two aspects. The first lies in utilizing theresidual matrix inspired by a state-of-the-art gradient boostingmodel, and the second stems from applying a sophisticatedlocal weighting scheme on the given matrix to enhance thelocality of topics, which in turn delivers high-quality, focusedtopics of interest to users. We evaluate our proposed method bycomparing it against other topic modeling methods, such as afew variants of NMF and latent Dirichlet allocation, in termsof various evaluation measures representing topic coherence, diversity, coverage, computing time, and so on.

Improving the Prediction Cost of Drift Handling Algorithms by Abstaining,Pierre-Xavier Loeffel (University of Paris)Vincent Lemaire (Orange S.A.)Christophe Marsala (Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University)Marcin Detyniecki (Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University),"2228415384,2096732835,2143746085,225995244","The problem considered in this paper is regression with a constraint on the precision of each prediction in the framework of data streams subject to concept drifts (when the hidden distribution which generates the observations can change over time). Concept drifts can diminish the reliability of the predictions over time and it might not be possible to output a prediction which satisfies the constraints on the precision. In this case, we claim that if the costs associated with a good and with a bad prediction are known beforehand, the overall prediction cost can be improved by allowing the regressor to abstain. To this end, we propose a generic method, compatible with any regressor, which uses an ensemble of reliability estimators to estimate whether the constraints on the precision of a given prediction can be met or not. In the later case, the regressor is allowed to abstain.

A Deep Learning Approach for the Prediction of Retail Store Sales,Yuta KanekoKatsutoshi Yada (Kansai University),"2568232080,2079431324","The purpose of this research is to construct a sales prediction model for retail stores using the deep learning approach, which has gained significant attention in the rapidly developing field of machine learning in recent years. Using such a model for analysis, an approach to store management could be formulated. The present study uses three years' worth of point-of-sale (POS) data from a retail store to construct a sales prediction model that, given the sales of a particular day, predicts the changes in sales on the following day. As a result, a deep learning model that considers the L1 regularization achieved a sale forecasting accuracy rate of 86%. The products at the retail store have been finely categorized. Even if the attributes of the product categories are increased in number from tens to thousands, the predictive accuracy did not fall by more than about 7%. In contrast, the accuracy decreased by around 13% when the logistic regression model was used. These results indicate that deep learning is highly suitable for constructing models that include multi-attribute variables.

In these seasonal calving systems, a concise period of breeding is essential to ensure the alignment of peak grass availability with peak lactating cow energy demands. Trials and statistical analysis have identified the factors affecting overall reproductive performance, but few studies have analysed performance at the individual service level. In this paper, four binary models of service outcome are described, incorporating age, stage of lactation, calving events, and measures of energy balance and milk production. Random effects at the cow, sire and herd level were included. Logistic regression and generalised additive models were created, both as stand-alone predictors and using ensemble learning in the form of bagging. The four models were evaluated in terms of calibration and discrimination using an external dataset of nine dairy herds representing the typical Irish pasture-based system. Logistic regression (with and without bagging) and generalised additive modelling with bagging all performed satisfactorily and would be useful as stand-alone models or in whole-farm simulation. Logistic regression is suggested as the most useful model for farmers and their advisers due to ease of interpretation.

However, CNN and other traditional methods require the input data to be of the same dimension which prevents its direct application on data of various lengths and multi-channel time series with different sampling rates across channels. Long short-term memory (LSTM), another tool in the deep learning arsenal and with its design nature, is more appropriate for problems involving time series such as speech recognition and language translation. In this paper, we propose a novel model incorporating a sequence-to-sequence model that consists two LSTMs, one encoder and one decoder. The encoder LSTM accepts input time series of arbitrary lengths, extracts information from the raw data and based on which the decoder LSTM constructs fixed length sequences that can be regarded as discriminatory features. For better utilization of the raw data, we also introduce the attention mechanism into our model so that the feature generation process can peek at the raw data and focus its attention on the part of the raw data that is most relevant to the feature under construction.

It separates a data matrix into a low-rank part and a sparse part. The convex approach has been well studied in the literature. However, state-of-the-art algorithms for the convex approach usually have relatively high complexity due to the need of solving (partial) singular value decompositions of large matrices. A non-convex approach, AltProj, has also been proposed with lighter complexity and better scalability. Given the true rank r of the underlying low rank matrix, AltProj has a complexity of O(r2dn), where d × n is the size of data matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel factorization-based model of RPCA, which has a complexity of O(kdn), where k is an upper bound of the true rank. Our method does not need the precise value of the true rank. From extensive experiments, we observe that AltProj can work only when r is precisely known in advance, however, when the needed rank parameter r is specified to a value different from the true rank, AltProj cannot fully separate the two parts while our method succeeds. Even when both work, our method is about 4 times faster than AltProj.

Some recent works have exploited Global Positioning System (GPS) devices and used classification of GPS traces to tackle the problem. Existing approaches based on GPS data make use of GPS trajectories sampled at high frequency (about 1 sample per second), but GPS trackers currently installed on public and commercial fleets acquire GPS positions at lower frequency (about 1 sample per minute). In this paper, we target the more challenging scenario of low frequency GPS data, which has not been tackled yet in the literature, and explore how this kind of data can be used to effectively categorise vehicles into light-duty and heavy-duty. We define several distance-, speed-, and acceleration-based features, inspired by the literature on related problems like travel mode detection, and add novel features based on road type. Features are aggregated over a GPS track with several aggregation functions. We identify the most effective combinations of features and aggregation functions with a data-driven approach, by applying Recursive Feature Elimination in a cross validation framework. Furthermore, we combine predictions of all tracks of a vehicle to boost classification performance. Experimental results on a large dataset show that the selected features are indeed effective and that the high and low frequency GPS scenarios greatly differ in terms of relevant features.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: axleglobal positioning systemaccelerationfeature extractionestimationdata miningmachine learningsimulationstatisticscomputer science
Inference of Partial Canonical Correlation Networks with Application to Stock Market Portfolio Selection,Gregory BreardNatallia Katenka (University of Rhode Island),"2096835635,2068216664","In recent years, association networks and their applications have received increasing interest. The relationships in a network should ideally be ascertained without any preconceptions about the existence of a connection a priori. This would allow interpretations to be based on the underlying structure rather than on assumptions. Furthermore, a method that discounts outside influence on the relationships is desirable. Partial correlation is one method that meets these criteria, however, this approach is limited to a single attribute. We propose that examining the multi-attribute partial canonical correlations is a superior strategy for capturing the complex relationships found in real world data. As a motivating application, we choose the problem of stock market portfolio selection. Diversification is a core principle of any sound investment strategy, the purpose being to minimize risk and maximize returns. To create a diverse portfolio, the interrelations between corporations and the industrial sectors that they comprise must be understood. To model these relationships we induce a partial canonical correlation network (PCCN) using recent market data and select portfolios algorithmically based on finding the least dependent but related companies. We compare the risk of portfolios selected from the PCCN, partial correlation networks, and randomly. We find that the PCCN based-approach results in comparatively less risky portfolios.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: correlationsoftware testingactuarial sciencestatisticsmathematics

When acquiring useful patterns from them, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) models have proven to be highly effective because of their fine representativeness of non-negative data. However, current NMF techniques suffer from a) inefficiency in addressing HiDS matrices, and b) constrained training schemes lack of flexibility, extensibility and adaptability. To address these issues, this work proposes to factorize industrial-size sparse matrices via a novel Inherently Non-negative Latent Factor (INLF) model. It connects the output factors and decision variables via a single-element-dependent sigmoid function, thereby innovatively removing the non-negativity constraints from its training process without impacting the solution accuracy. Hence, its training process is unconstrained, highly flexible and compatible with general learning schemes. Experimental results on five HiDS matrices generated by industrial applications indicate that INLF is able to acquire non-negative latent factors from them in a more efficient manner than any existing method does.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: manganeseestimationdata miningmachine learningsimulationstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Yet repurposing of traditional forecasting approaches has proven ineffective, in part due to issues such as sparsity, but often due to inapplicable underpinning assumptions such as stationarity and ergodicity. In this paper we derive a principled new approach to forecasting event series that avoids such assumptions, based upon: 1. The processing of event series datasets in order to produce a first parameterized mixture model of non-homogeneous Poisson processes, and 2.

A Theoretical Analysis of the Fuzzy K-Means Problem,Johannes Blomer (University of Paderborn)Sascha BrauerKathrin Bujna (University of Paderborn),"138736257,2299307526,101389126","One of the most popular fuzzy clustering techniques is the fuzzy K-means algorithm (also known as fuzzy-c-means or FCM algorithm). In contrast to the K-means and K-median problem, the underlying fuzzy K-means problem has not been studied from a theoretical point of view. In particular, there are no algorithms with approximation guarantees similar to the famous K-means++ algorithm known for the fuzzy K-means problem. This work initiates the study of the fuzzy K-means problem from an algorithmic and complexity theoretic perspective. We show that optimal solutions for the fuzzy K-means problem cannot, in general, be expressed by radicals over the input points. Surprisingly, this already holds for simple inputs in one-dimensional space. Hence, one cannot expect to compute optimal solutions exactly. We give the first (1+eps)-approximation algorithms for the fuzzy K-means problem. First, we present a deterministic approximation algorithm whose runtime is polynomial in N and linear in the dimension D of the input set, given that K is constant, i.e. a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for fixed K. We achieve this result by showing that for each soft clustering there exists a hard clustering with similar properties. Second, by using techniques known from coreset constructions for the K-means problem, we develop a deterministic approximation algorithm that runs in time almost linear in N but exponential in the dimension D. We complement these results with a randomized algorithm which imposes some natural restrictions on the sought solution and whose runtime is comparable to some of the most efficient approximation algorithms for K-means, i.e. linear in the number of points and the dimension, but exponential in the number of clusters.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: type 2 fuzzy sets and systemscorrelation clusteringfuzzy numberfrequency modulationcluster analysisalgorithm designalgorithmicsapproximation algorithmdiscrete mathematicscombinatoricsdata miningmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Beyond Points and Paths: Counting Private Bodies,Maryam Fanaeepour (University of Melbourne)Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein (University of Melbourne),"266336517,617941202","Mining of spatial data is an enabling technology for mobile services, Internet-connected cars, and the Internet of Things. But the very distinctiveness of spatial data that drives utility, comes at the cost of user privacy. In this work, we continue the tradition of privacy-preserving spatial analytics, focusing not on point or path data, but on planar spatial regions. Such data represents the area of a user's most frequent visitation—such as ""around home and nearby shops"". Specifically we consider the differentially-private release of data structures that support range queries for counting users' spatial regions. Counting planar regions leads to unique challenges not faced in existing work. A user's spatial region that straddles multiple data structure cells can lead to duplicate counting at query time. We provably avoid this pitfall by leveraging the Euler characteristic. To address the increased sensitivity of range queries to spatial region data, we calibrate privacy-preserving noise using bounded user region size and a constrained inference that uses robust least absolute deviations.

To enable knowledge discovery from such networked data, network representation learning (NRL) aims to learn vector representations for network nodes, such that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms can be directly applied. To date, existing NRL methods either primarily focus on network structure or simply combine node content and topology for learning. We argue that in information networks, information is mainly originated from three sources: (1) homophily, (2) topology structure, and (3) node content. Homophily states social phenomenon where individuals sharing similar attributes (content) tend to be directly connected through local relational ties, while topology structure emphasizes more on global connections. To ensure effective network representation learning, we propose to augment three information sources into one learning objective function, so that the interplay roles between three parties are enforced by requiring the learned network representations (1) being consistent with node content and topology structure, and also (2) following the social homophily constraints in the learned space. Experiments on multi-class node classification demonstrate that the representations learned by the proposed method consistently outperform state-of-the-art NRL methods, especially for very sparsely labeled networks.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: logical topologycontext modelnetwork topologydata miningmachine learningcomputer science

Brain injuries lack of surgical or pharmacological therapies, therefore Cognitive Rehabilitation (CR) is the generally adopted treatment. Computerized CR tasks are increasingly replacing traditional ""paper and pencil"" approaches. Nevertheless, CR plans are manually designed by clinicians from scratch based on their own experience. There is very little research on the amount and type of practice that occurs during computerized CR treatments and its relationship to patients' outcomes. While task repetition is not the only important feature, it is becoming clear that neuroplastic change and functional improvement occur after specific tasks are performed, but do not occur with others. In this work we focus on the preprocessing, patterns and knowledge extraction phases of a Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) framework. We propose considering CR programs as sequences of sessions and pattern searching (association rules, classification models, clustering and shallow neural models) to support clinicians in the selection of specific interventions (e.g. tasks assignations). The proposed framework is applied to 40000 tasks executions from real clinical setting.

Much work has focused on designing objective functions and optimization algorithms for learning b-bit hash functions from a dataset. Recent work has shown that comparable or better results can be obtained by training b hash functions independently from each other and making them cooperate by introducing diversity with ensemble learning techniques.

Nevertheless, the widely-existing class imbalance problem has not been well investigated. Furthermore, previous imbalanced classification methods lack of efforts in studying the complex imbalance problem in a distributed environment. In this paper, we consider the imbalance problem as distributed data imbalance which includes three imbalance issues: (i) within-node class imbalance, (ii)between-node class imbalance, and (iii) between-node structure imbalance. In order to adequately deal with imbalanced data as well as improve time efficiency, a novel distributed Cost-Sensitive classification algorithm via Group-based ADMM (CS-GADMM) is proposed. Briefly, CS-GADMM derives the classification problem as a series of sub-problems with within-node class imbalance. To alleviate the time delay caused by between-node class imbalance, we propose a extension of dual coordinate descent method for the sub-problem optimization. Meanwhile, for between-node structure imbalance, we discreetly study the relationship between local functions, and combine the resulting local variables intra-group to update the global variables for prediction.

Generally speaking, a community refers to a group of densely linked nodes in the network. Nodes usually have more than one community label, indicating their multiple roles or functions in the network. Unfortunately, existing solutions aiming at overlapping-community-detection are not capable of scaling to large-scale networks with millions of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a fast overlapping-communitydetection algorithm — FOX. In the experiment on a network with 3.9 millions nodes and 20 millions edges, the detection finishes in 14 minutes and provides the most qualified results. The second fastest algorithm, however, takes ten times longer to run. As for another network with 22 millions nodes and 127 millions edges, our algorithm is the only one that can provide an overlapping community detection result and it only takes 238 minutes. Our algorithm draws lessons from potential games, a concept in game theory. We measure the closeness of a node to a community by counting the number of triangles formed by the node and two other nodes form the community. Potential games ensure that the algorithm can reach convergence.

Thus, the aim of this study is to detect the in-season short-term training cycles in an Italian elite football team. 80 trainings of 26 elite football players were monitored during 23 in-season weeks by a global position system (GPS). Machine learning process and autocorrelation analyses were performed in order to detect pattern inside in-season football trainings. Extra tree random forest classifier (ETRFC) was used to create a supervised machine learning process able to describe the football trainings cycle. This analytical model allows us to produce reliable decisions and results learning from historical relationships and trends in the data. In addition, the autocorrelation analysis allows us to detect similarity between observations between the data. Based on these analysis, it was found that the in-season football trainings are characterized by a series of short-term cycles. This kind of periodization follows a sinusoidal model because the short-term cycle detected in the in-season trainings is composed of two parts with different training loads. In particular, in the days long before the match football players perform higher training loads than in the close ones. To enhance performance and reduce risk of injuries, it would be essential to provide correct stimuli in each short-term cycle per day. Thus, developing a valid method able to define the correct training loads in each training day may be central for coaches and athletic trainers to periodize correctly the football trainings.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: global positioning systemaccelerationcorrelationfeature extractionalgorithm designartificial intelligencemachine learningsimulationcomputer science

We present a new approach for learning hierarchically decomposable concepts.

Soliciting labels at a finer level of granularity than that of the target concept is a new approach to active learning, which we term active over-labeling. In experiments in NER and document classification tasks, we show that active over-labeling substantially improves area under the precision-recall curve when compared with standard passive or active learning. Finally, because finer-grained labels may be more expensive to obtain, we also present a cost-sensitive active learner that uses a multi-armed bandit approach to dynamically choose the label granularity to target, and show that the bandit-based learner is robust to differences in label cost and labeling budget.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: active learningmaterial properties of diamondlabeling theorycost benefit analysisactive learningsemi supervised learningdata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningcomputer science

Effects of homophily and triadic closure mechanisms are claimed to be important in terms of initiating new social interactions and in turn to shape the global social structure. This way they eventually provide some potential to predict the creation of social ties between disconnected people sharing common friends or common subjects of interest. In this paper we analyze a large Twitter data corpus and quantify similarities between people by considering the set of their common friends and the set of their commonly shared hashtags in order to predict mention links among them. We show that these similarity measures are correlated among connected people and that the combination of contextual and local structural features provides better predictions as compared to cases where they are considered separately. These results help us to better understand the evolution of egocentric and global social networks and provide advances in the design of better recommendation systems and resource allocation plans.,2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: accelerationmeasurementresource managementworld wide webdata miningmachine learning

However, its shortcomings can not be neglected, especially its time complexity. Consequently a great amount of approaches emerged in large numbers in decades to cope with this issue with a tradeoff in performance of the classification. In this paper, a novel improved kNN algorithm is proposed with a better performance than traditional kNN when its time complexity is meanwhile reduced. In the proposed algorithm, a pre-classification which cost little time is to be conducted before proposed kNN algorithm. Then the training set can be divided into several parts according to the classification probability with some thresholds. After that the parts with probability nearer to 1 or 0 are selected to be training sets. The accuracy rate and the area under the ROC curve (the receiver operating characteristic curve) of the proposed algorithm is calculated and compared with basic kNN algorithm in the experiments. The experiment results show that not only the pre-classification based kNN algorithm greatly reduced the time cost, but it also performs better than the original kNN algorithm in accuracy and AUC (the area under the ROC curve).",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: decision treesensitivitytime complexitypredictionstatistical classificationdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

For these applications, how to aggregate the preferences of different group members is the toughest yet most important problem. Inspired by game theory, in this paper, we propose to explore the idea of Nash equilibrium to simulate the selections of members in a group by a game process. Along this line, we first compute the preferences (group-dependent optimal selections) of each individual member in a given group scene, i.e., an equilibrium solution of this group, with the help of two pruning approaches. Then, to get the aggregated unitary preference of each group from all group members, we design a matrix factorization-based method which aggregates the preferences in latent space and estimates the final group preference in rating space. After obtaining the group preference, group-oriented services (e.g., group recommendation) can be directly provided.

Structural Combination of Neural Network Models,Juan RendonLilian M. de Menezes,"2584594597,2696932880","Forecasts combinations normally use point forecasts that were obtained from different models or sources ([1], [2],[3]).

Graph-Structured Sparse Optimization for Connected Subgraph Detection,Baojian ZhouFeng Chen,"2650831512,2646924766","Structured sparse optimization is an important and challenging problem for analyzing high-dimensional data in a variety of applications such as bioinformatics, medical imaging, social networks, and astronomy. Although a number of structured sparsity models have been explored, such as trees, groups, clusters, and paths, connected subgraphs have been rarely explored in the current literature. One of the main technical challenges is that there is no structured sparsity-inducing norm that can directly model the space of connected subgraphs, and there is no exact implementation of a projection oracle for connected subgraphs due to its NP-hardness. In this paper, we explore efficient approximate projection oracles for connected subgraphs, and propose two new efficient algorithms, namely, Graph-IHT and Graph-GHTP, to optimize a generic nonlinear objective function subject to connectivity constraint on the support of the variables. Our proposed algorithms enjoy strong guarantees analogous to several current methods for sparsity-constrained optimization, such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Approximate Model Iterative Hard Thresholding (AM-IHT), and Gradient Hard Thresholding Pursuit (GHTP) with respect to convergence rate and approximation accuracy. We apply our proposed algorithms to optimize several well-known graph scan statistics in several applications of connected subgraph detection as a case study, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: siliconalgorithm designmathematical modelapproximation algorithmtheoretical computer sciencecombinatoricsdata miningmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Cluster-Based Sorted Neighborhood for Efficient Duplicate Detection,Ahmad Samiei (Hasso Plattner Institute)Felix Naumann (Hasso Plattner Institute),"2476290279,2099727678","Duplicate detection intends to find multiple and syntactically different representations of the same real-world entities in a dataset. The naive way of duplicate detection entails a quadratic number of pair-wise record comparisons to identify the duplicates. This number of comparisons might take hours even for an average sized dataset. As today's databases grow very fast, different candidate-selection methods, such as sorted neighborhood, blocking, canopy clustering and their variations, address this problem by shrinking the comparison space. The volume and velocity of data-change require ever faster and more flexible methods of duplicate detection. In particular, they need dynamic indices that can be updated efficiently as new data arrives. We present a novel approach, which combines the idea of cluster-based methods with the well-known sorted neighborhood method. It carefully filters out irrelevant candidate pairs, which are less likely to yield duplicates, by pre-clustering records based not only on their proximity after sorting, but also on their similarity in selected attributes. An empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that our approach improves the overall runtime over existing approaches while maintaining comparable result quality.

We are particularly motivated to demonstrate the utility of algorithms for the self identification of smart phones. A framework is designed to quantify: (i) the dissimilarity in behaviours among any two users, (ii) the exclusivity of each user's behaviour (inclass) from the world (outclass). A central element of the proposed framework is to first identify a discriminating representation for each user. To this end, an autoencoder is employed in which the goal is to identify an encoding that rebuilds the original data with maximum accuracy/ least loss. The hypothesis of this work is that such an autoencoding step provides an effective mechanism for discovering good data representations prior to the application of a data description technique, such as clustering. Both the autoencoder and the clustering steps are performed relative to a single user.

Extracting feature groups automatically from such data with several correlated features is necessary, in order to use regularizers such as the group lasso which can exploit this deciphered grouping structure to build effective prediction models. Elastic net, fused-lasso and Octagonal Shrinkage Clustering Algorithm for Regression (oscar) are some of the popular feature grouping methods proposed in the literature which recover both sparsity and feature groups from the data. However, their predictive ability is affected adversely when the regression coefficients of adjacent feature groups are similar, but not exactly equal. This happens as these methods merge such adjacent feature groups erroneously, which is also called the misfusion problem. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a weighted l1 norm-based approach which is effective at recovering feature groups, despite the proximity of the coefficients of adjacent feature groups, building extremely accurate predictive models. This convex optimization problem is solved using the fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (FISTA).

We also develop a prototype demo system named TopicAtlas to exhibit such heterogeneous topic web, and demonstrate how this system can facilitate the task of text network exploration. Extensive qualitative analyses are included to verify the effectiveness of this heterogeneous topic web. Besides, we validate our model on real-life text networks, showing that it preserves good performance on objective evaluation metrics.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: co occurrence networksnoisy text analyticsprobabilistic logicnickelprototypecomputational modeltext miningdata scienceworld wide webdata miningmachine learningcomputer science
airVLC: An Application for Visualizing Wind-Sensitive Interpolation of Urban Air Pollution Forecasts,Lidia Contreras-OchandoCesar Ferri (Polytechnic University of Valencia),"2585840281,2643711545","Air pollution has been identified as a major source of health problems for people living in cities. In this sense, it is important to identify the areas of the city that present high levels of pollutants in order to avoid them. airVLC is an application for predicting and interpolating real-time urban air pollution forecasts for the city of Valencia (Spain). We compare different regression models in order to predict the levels of four pollutants (NO, NO2, SO2, O3) in the six measurement stations of the city. Since wind is a key feature in the dispersion of the pollution, we study different techniques to incorporate this factor in the models. Finally, we are able to interpolate forecasts all around the city. For this goal, we propose a new interpolation method that takes wind direction into account, improving well-known methods like IDW or Kriging. By using these pollution estimates, we are able to generate real-time pollution maps of the city of Valencia and publish them into a public website.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: air pollutioninterpolationpredictive modellingmachine learningcomputer science
Visual Context Learning with Big Data Analytics,Mayanka Chandrashekar (University of Missouri–Kansas City)Yugyung Lee (University of Missouri–Kansas City),"2311788989,2113943634","Understanding contextual information composed of both text and images is very useful for multimedia information processing. However, capturing such contexts is not trivial, especially while dealing with real datasets. Existing solutions such as using ontologies (e.g., WordNet) are mainly interested in individual terms, but they do not support identifying a group of terms that describe a specific context available at runtime. Within our knowledge, there are very limited solutions regarding the integration of contextual information from both images and text. Furthermore, existing solutions are not scalable due to the computationally intensive tasks and are prone to data sparsity. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework, called VisContextthat is based on a contextual model combined with images and text. The VisContext framework is based on the scalable pipeline that is composed of the primary components as follows: (i)Natural Language Processing (NLP), (ii) Feature extraction usingTerm Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), (iii)Feature association using unsupervised learning algorithms including K-Means clustering (KM) and Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithms, iv) Validation of visual context models using supervised learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests). The proposed VisContext framework has been implemented with the Spark MLlib and CoreNLP. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the framework in visual understanding with three large datasets (IAPR, Flick3k, SBU) containing more than one million images and their annotations. The results are reported in the discovery of the contextual association of terms and images, image context visualization, and image classification based on contexts.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: context modelvisualizationfeature extractionbig datasemanticsdata sciencedata miningmachine learningcomputer science

To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, namely Semi-Supervised Multi-Label Dimensionality Reduction (SSMLDR), which can utilize the information from both labeled data and unlabeled data in an effective way. First, the proposed algorithm enlarges the multi-label information from the labeled data to the unlabeled data through a special designed label propagation method.

Dynamic Contextual Multi Arm Bandits in Display Advertisement,Hongxia YangQuan Lu,"2701469130,2676612536","We model the ad selection task as a multi-armed bandit problem. Standard assumptions in the multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting are that samples drawn from each arm areindependent and identically distributed, rewards (or conversionrates in our scenario) are stationary and rewards feedback areimmediate. Although the payoff function of an arm is allowed toevolve over time, the evolution is assumed to be slow. Display ads, on the other hand, are regularly created while others are removed from circulation. This can occur when budgets run out, campaign goal changes, holiday season ends and many other latent factors that go beyond the control of the ad selection system. Another big challenge is that the set of available ads is often extremely huge but standard multi-armed bandit strategies converge with linear time complexity that cannot accommodate the usually dynamic changes. Due to the above challenges and the restrictions of the original MAB, we propose a novel dynamic contextual MAB which tightly integrates components of dynamic conversion rates prediction, contextual learning and arm overlapping modeling in a principled framework. Besides we propose an accompaniedmeta analyses framework that allows us to conclude experiments in a more statistically robust manner. We demonstrate on a world leading demand side platform (DSP) that our framework can effectively discriminate premium arms and significantly outperform some standard variations of MAB to these settings.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: digital signal processingpredictive modellingalgorithm designstochastic processdata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningsimulationstatisticscomputer science
SemStim: Exploiting Knowledge Graphs for Cross-Domain Recommendation,"Benjamin Heitmann (National University of Ireland, Galway)Conor Hayes (National University of Ireland, Galway)","2311535950,2099954206","In this paper we introduce SemStim, an unsupervised graph-based algorithm that addresses the cross-domain recommendation task. In this task, preferences from one conceptual domain (e.g. movies) are used to recommend items belonging to another domain (e.g. music). SemStim exploits the semantic links found in a knowledge graph (e.g. DBpedia), to connect domains and thus generate recommendations. As a key benefit, our algorithm does not require (1) ratings in the target domain, thus mitigating the cold-start problem and (2) overlap between users or items from the source and target domains. In contrast, current state-of-the-art personalisation approaches either have an inherent limitation to one domain or require rating data in the source and target domains. We evaluate SemStim by comparing its accuracy to state-of-the-art algorithms for the top-k recommendation task, for both single-domain and cross-domain recommendations.

We first collect students information from multi-modal channels, including their behaviors of campus consumption, internet usage, daily trajectory together with their enrollment information. The approval status and amount of funds granted are converted as labels. We propose the College Student Scholarships and Subsidies Granting (CS3G) approach to address the concrete problem. CS3G approach overcomes 3 obstacles, i.e., complicated multi-label influences, private modal information protection and difficulties in label collection. In detail, based on the facts that scholarships mainly depend on academic achievements, subsidies granting is generally based on students financial hardships as well as credits, and there are implicit influences among scholarships and subsidies, the CS3G approach handles types of interactions between multiple labels, it is notable that data from different modalities are collected by different divisions of a university, privacy protection is considered in CS3G, i.e., no interaction between features from different modalities in the model training phase. Besides, due to the confidentiality of the concrete types/amounts of granting, only a portion of labels is collected in this application, CS3G is trained in a semi-supervised style. Empirical investigations show good generalization ability of CS3G on benchmark datasets, and a real assessment of a university also validates the power of our approach for tackling this type of problem well.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: concretetrajectorythe internetfeature extractionresource managementoperations researchdata miningmachine learningsimulationcomputer science

That is, the sparse reconstruction error and classification error are combined for joint minimization, which clearly differs from traditional methods that explicitly separate graph construction and label propagation into independent steps, which may result in inaccurate predictions. Note that our Adaptive-NP alternately optimize the sparse codes and soft labels matrices, where the sparse codes are used as adaptive weights for neighborhood propagation at each iteration, so the tricky process of determining neighborhood size or kernel width is avoided. Besides, for enhancing sparse coding, we use the L2,1-norm constraint on the sparse coding coefficients and the reconstruction error at the same time for delivering more accurate and robust representations.

Incorporate Hashing with Multi-view Learning,Jingjing TangDewei Li,"2584446109,2584259980","Multi-view learning concentrates on multiple distinct feature sets mainly following either the consensus principle or the complementary principle.

Motivated by PDH, we propose a novel strategy: Incorporate Hashing with Multi-view Learning (IHMVL). The specific implementation of IHMVL is to incorporate the PDH algorithm with SVM-2K for two-view classification, which suffices to both the consensus and complementary principles.

Recent years have witnessed the encouraging potentials of deep neural networks for real-life applications of various domains. Traffic speed prediction, however, is still in its initial stage without making full use of spatio-temporal traffic information. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a deep learning method with an Error-feedback Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network structure (eRCNN) for continuous traffic speed prediction. By integrating the spatio-temporal traffic speeds of contiguous road segments as an input matrix, eRCNN explicitly leverages the implicit correlations among nearby segments to improve the predictive accuracy. By further introducing separate error feedback neurons to the recurrent layer, eRCNN learns from prediction errors so as to meet predictive challenges rising from abrupt traffic events such as morning peaks and traffic accidents. Extensive experiments on real-life speed data of taxis running on the 2nd and 3rd ring roads of Beijing city demonstrate the strong predictive power of eRCNN in comparison to some state-of-the-art competitors.

Graphs are another text representation scheme that considers the structure of terms in the text document which is important for natural language. Terms weighted on the basis of graph representation increase the performance of text classification.

In this paper, we utilize the web browsing sequences of users, which can directly reflect the logical trajectories of individuals in cyberspace, to depict the profile for each user. Based on these profiles, two approaches are proposed to authenticate the web user's identity. The first one is MSIA (Markov Sequence based Identity Authentication). In MSIA, we construct a behavioral Markov model to depict each user's logical behavior. The second one is SPIA (Sequence and Preference based Identity Authentication). In SPIA, two non-sequential features, i.e. the browsing time and the classes of web pages, are further included in MSIA to strengthen the modeling ability. In addition, both of these two approaches are user-friendly, which means the process of behavioral authenticating is running as daemons. The daemons verify user's identity continuously and invisibly during the whole browsing period, instead of one-time authentication at login stage. Based on the behavioral data of 1000 users collected from China Internet Network Information Center, we verify the proposed methods on 1,496,758 test sequences.

The analysis of this kind of information will provide teams with competitive advantages, by gaining a deeper understanding of the relation between training and match load, and individual player's fitness characteristics. In order to make sense of this physical data, which is inherently complex, machine learning algorithms that exploit both non-linear and linear relations among variables could be of great aid on building predictive and explanatory models. Also, the increasing availability of information brings the necessity and the challenge for successful interpretation of these models in order to be able to translate the findings into information that can be quickly applied by fast-paced practitioners, such as physical coaches. For season 2015-2016 F. C. Barcelona has collected both physical information from both training sessions and matches using EPTS devices. This study focuses primarily on evaluating up to what extent is possible to predict match performance from training and match physical information. Different machine learning algorithms are applied for building predictive regression models, in combination with feature selection techniques and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Physical Variables are segmented into three groups: Locomotor, Metabolic and Mechanical variables, reaching successful prediction rates in 11 out of 17 total variables, based on a threshold determined by expert physical coaches. A normalized root mean square error metric is proposed that allows better understanding of results for practitioners. The second part of this study is focused on understanding the predictor variables that better explain each of the 17 analyzed match variables.

Clustering plays an important role in mining knowledge from HIN. Several HIN clustering algorithms have been proposed in recent years. However, these algorithms suffer from one or moreof the following problems: (1) inability to model general HINs, (2) inability to simultaneously generate clusters for all types of objects, (3) inability to use similarity information of the objects with the same type.

The goal of patient similarity learning is to derive a clinically meaningful measure to evaluate the similarity amongst patients represented by their key clinical indicators. However, it is challenging to learn such similarity, as medical data are usually high dimensional, heterogeneous, and complex. In addition, a desirable patient similarity is dependent on particular clinical settings, which implies supervised learning scheme is more useful in medical domains. To address these, in this paper we present a novel similarity learning approach formulated as the generalized Mahalanobis similarity function with pairwise constraints.

Another important aspect of these data is that their characteristics change over time. The identification of the ongoing change in the monitored data sequence, also called ""concept drift"", can significantly help to improve prediction accuracy by prediction model adaptation to the drifts. The challenge is to perform these model adaptations online. We have proposed an incremental adaptive method for time series prediction.

Risk-Aware Dynamic Reserve Prices of Programmatic Guarantee in Display Advertising,Bowei Chen,2580439005,"Display advertising is one important online advertising type where banner advertisements (shortly ad) on websites are usually measured by how many times they are viewed by online users. There are two major channels to sell ad views. They can be auctioned off in real time or be directly sold through guaranteed contracts in advance. The former is also known as real-time bidding (RTB), in which media buyers come to a common marketplace to compete for a single ad view and this inventory will be allocated to a buyer in milliseconds by an auction model. Unlike RTB, buying and selling guaranteed contracts are not usually programmatic but through private negotiations as advertisers would like to customise their requests and purchase ad views in bulk. In this paper, we propose a simple model that facilitates the automation of direct sales. In our model, a media seller puts future ad views on sale and receives buy requests sequentially over time until the future delivery period. The seller maintains a hidden yet dynamically changing reserve price in order to decide whether to accept a buy request or not. The future supply and demand are assumed to be well estimated and static, and the model's revenue management is using inventory control theory where each computed reverse price is based on the updated supply and demand, and the unsold future ad views will be auctioned off in RTB to the meet the unfulfilled demand. The model has several desirable properties. First, it is not limited to the demand arrival assumption. Second, it will not affect the current equilibrium between RTB and direct sales as there are no posted guaranteed prices. Third, the model uses the expected revenue from RTB as a lower bound for inventory control and we show that a publisher can receive expected total revenue greater than or equal to those from only RTB if she uses the computed dynamic reserves prices for direct sales.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: inventory controlmediasupply and demandcomputational modelmathematical economicsadvertisingcommercemicroeconomicsmarketingeconomicscomputer science

Relative Label Encoding for the Prediction of Airline Passenger Nationality,Alejandro MottiniRodrigo Acuna-Agost,"2705128823,2630677489","In the airline industry, a Passenger Name Record (PNR) stores the travel itinerary of an individual or group of passengers travelling together. A PNR always contains all the flight information regarding each segment of a journey, and may contain additional important information such as nationality, gender and age of the passengers. From a commercial point of view, these passenger attributes are of particular interest to all actors in the travel industry (e.g., airlines and airports). However, on average, only ten percent of PNR records have this information. Therefore, their prediction is of great interest. In this study we propose a methodology to predict the nationality of passengers based on PNR data. To avoid having to solve a classification problem with 195 classes, most of which will not be well represented in the data, we take advantage of a peculiarity of this data. In most cases, the nationality of a passenger will match the value of one or more of the other PNR attributes. Therefore, we can encode the target variable by transforming the nationality country code into the index of the feature it matches (e.g., country of origin or destination of the trip). The relative encoding of the target variable allows us to simplify the original problem significantly, while obtaining better classification accuracy. Since the new classes are non-exclusive, the problem falls in the multi-label classification paradigm. The proposed methodology was tested on PNR data of passengers passing through an important European airport, which handles more than twenty million passengers per year. The model performance was evaluated using three indicators. Results show that we are able to predict the nationalities with good accuracy, and outperform both a classical multi-class methodology and a ad-hoc rule-based algorithm used in the industry.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: feature extractionencodingoperations researchdata miningmachine learningcomputer science
Faster Univariate Microaggregation for Power Law Distributions: k-Degree-Anonymity for Big Graphs,Julian Salas,2630832865,"Microaggregation is a well known and widely used statistical disclosure limitaton method. In the case of univariate microaggregation, there is a polynomial time algorithm that obtains optimal partitions by representing the optimal partition as a shortest path in a directed acyclic graph. Such algorithm is frequently used for obtaining optimal k-degree anonymizations of networks. Since there is a large and growing amount of information, and datasets are increasing in size and complexity, there is a need to obtain faster algorithms. Most of the times their precision is dropped for making them faster, this is not the case of our algorithm. We present a technique for obtaining optimal univariate microaggregation in such a way that the number of calculations is considerably reduced without affecting optimality. We apply this result for k-anonymization of the degree sequences of networks with a power law distribution. To show that this method increases its efficiency when increasing the size of the degree sequences, we generated discrete power law distributions for different exponents α with sizes of up to a billion vertices, and compared the reduction of the degree sequences obtained.

Structural Nonparallel Support Vector Machine Based on LSH for Large-Scale Prediction,Dandan Chen,2583550797,"Considering the fact that the underlying structural information in the training data within classes is vital for a good classifier in real-world classification problems, Structural Nonparallel Support Vector Machine (or SNPSVM, for short) has been proposed. By combining the structural information with nonparallel support vector machine (NPSVM), SNPSVM can fully exploit prior knowledge to directly improve the algorithm’s generalization capacity, each model of which considers not only the compactness in both classes by the structural information but also the separability between classes. In recent decades, discussions on how to train effective classifiers on huge amount of data has attracted more and more research works across several communities. However, the counterpart scalability issue how to apply big trained models efficiently on huge non annotated media collections has been reported rarely. In this paper, we address the problem of speeding-up the prediction phase of linear SNPSVM via Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). We propose building efficient hash-based classifiers that are applied in a first stage in order to approximate the exact results and filter the hypothesis space. Furthermore, SNPSVM is solved efficiently by an alternating optimization method, called the improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The proposed SNPSVM based on LSH and the solving algorithm can guarantee that we can deal with large-scale classification problems with a huge number of instances as well as features. Experiments performed with millions of one-against-one classifiers show that the proposed hash-based classifier can be more than two orders of magnitude faster than the exact classifier with minor losses in quality.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: training setsupport vector machineapproximation algorithmdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Discovering Spatial Regions of High Correlation,Prerna AgarwalRicha VermaVenkata M. V. Gunturi,"2655529547,2584860575,2615636548","Given a set of events of two different types (e.g. locations of crime incidents/road accidents) in geographic space and minimum density and area thresholds, spatial regions of high correlation discovery (RHC) aims to determine rectangular-shaped areas of high correlation between two event types. RHC discovery is important to many fields like transportation engineering, criminology, and epidemiology. Designing a scalable algorithm for RHC discovery is challenging mainly because of non-monotonicity of popular spatial statistical interest measures of association between events, one such measure being the cross-K function. This challenge makes Apriori-based pruning algorithms inapplicable. The large enumeration space is another challenge. To address these limitations, we propose a cross-K inspired interest measure and using that, a novel algorithm for RHC discovery. Real crime data is used for a case study to present the output of our algorithm. Experimental evaluation is done to show that the proposed algorithm cuts down on computation substantially as compared to the naive approach.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: transportcorrelationcluster analysisalgorithm designdata sciencedata miningmachine learningsimulationcomputer science
Deep Convolutional Factor Analyser for Multivariate Time Series Modeling,Chao YuanAmit Chakraborty,"2505266043,2663953073","Deep generative models can perform dramatically better than traditional graphical models in a number of machine learning tasks. However, training such models remains challenging because their latent variables typically do not have an analytical posterior distribution, largely due to the nonlinear activation nodes. We present a deep convolutional factor analyser (DCFA) for multivariate time series modeling. Our network is constructed in a way that bottom layer nodes are independent. Through a process of up-sampling and convolution, higher layer nodes gain more temporal dependency. Our model can thus give a time series different representations at different depths. DCFA only consists of linear Gaussian nodes. Therefore, the posterior distributions of latent variables are also Gaussian and can be estimated easily using standard variational Bayes algorithm. We show that even without nonlinearity the proposed deep model can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly detection, classification and clustering using both synthetic and real-world datasets.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingconvolutionnormal distributiontime serieshidden markov modeldata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

In such a scenario, automatic detection of activities that they are involved in has many potential uses, and even presenting users with a summary of their current set of activities was found to be of value in itself. In this paper, we describe the problem of automatically detecting user activities from e-mails, while using only meta-data of e-mails, i.e., we do not process email contents. We present a novel two stage algorithm for automatic activity detection from users' e-mails: We first represent the e-mail dataset as a rectangular matrix using features such as other e-mails, people involved, and names of the documents attached in the e-mails. We next represent the emails in latent feature space using SVD, followed by further dimensionality reduction using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor embedding(t-SNE). We then cluster e-mails using density based clustering algorithm in t-SNE space. In the second stage we merge these clusters based on group properties and a community detection algorithm on the graph of clusters, to yield our set of automatically detected activities. We analyse public e-mail datasets and present benchmarks of our approach on real-life datasets collected from our target users, and also compare our algorithm with alternative approaches as well as those published in recent literature.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingfeature extractioncluster analysisapproximation algorithmdata scienceworld wide webdata miningmachine learningcomputer science
Event Detection for Urban Dynamic Data Streams,Septimiu Nechifor (Siemens)Ioana StefanMarten FischerDan Puiu (Siemens),"2006722859,2687861048,2144440008,2296059845","This paper presents a framework for processing the data generated by Smart City sensors and IoT data streams in real-time. The scope of processing is to detect various event patterns from the raw data. The framework is extensible because at any moment new data sources can be registered or new specific event detection mechanism can be deployed. The framework offers a HTTP interface which can be used to provide details about each data stream. In order to connect to the heterogeneous data source end points and fetching the observations a concept of simple adaptable data wrappers is introduced. Having the streams registered into the framework, the domain expert can deploy (using a Java API) the event detection mechanism. The domain expert (maybe with some help from an application developer) has only to develop the data wrappers and event detection modules. Once the modules are developed, they can be deployed any time and on any numbers for different sensors of the same type, respective similar events to be detected.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: complex event processingsoftware frameworkworld wide webdata miningreal time computingcomputer science
Learning from Your Network of Friends: A Trajectory Representation Learning Model Based on Online Social Ties,Basma Alharbi (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology)Xiangliang Zhang (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology),"2222004373,2129841492","Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) captureindividuals whereabouts for a large portion of the population. To utilize this data for user (location)-similarity based tasks, one must map the raw data into a low-dimensional uniformfeature space. However, due to the nature of LBSNs, manyusers have sparse and incomplete check-ins. In this work, we propose to overcome this issue by leveraging the networkof friends, when learning the new feature space. We firstanalyze the impact of friends on individuals's mobility, andshow that individuals trajectories are correlated with thoseof their friends and friends of friends (2-hop friends) inan online setting. Based on our observation, we propose amixed-membership model that infers global mobility patternsfrom users' check-ins and their network of friends, withoutimpairing the model's complexity.

EXTRACT: Strong Examples from Weakly-Labeled Sensor Data,Davis W. BlalockJohn V. Guttag,"2718592430,2651089530","Thanks to the rise of wearable and connected devices, sensor-generated time series comprise a large and growing fraction of the world's data. Unfortunately, extracting value from this data can be challenging, since sensors report low-level signals (e.g., acceleration), not the high-level events that are typically of interest (e.g., gestures). We introduce a technique to bridge this gap by automatically extracting examples of real-world events in low-level data, given only a rough estimate of when these events have taken place. By identifying sets of features that repeat in the same temporal arrangement, we isolate examples of such diverse events as human actions, power consumption patterns, and spoken words with up to 96% precision and recall. Our method is fast enough to run in real time and assumes only minimal knowledge of which variables are relevant or the lengths of events. Our evaluation uses numerous publicly available datasets and over 1 million samples of manually labeled sensor data.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: accelerationsparse matrixfeature extractiontime seriesshapedata sciencedata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics
Graph-Based Term Weighting Scheme for Topic Modeling,Giannis BekoulisFrancois Rousseau,"2585720006,2585510497","LSI and LDA are widely used techniques to uncover the underlying topical structure of text. They traditionally rely on bag-of-words representation of documents and term frequency-based (TF) weighting schemes. In this paper, we represent documents as graph-of-words to capture the relationships between close words and propose the number of contexts of co-occurrences as alternative term weights (TW). Experiments with a downstream supervised task show that counting the importance of a node inside the graph results in statistically significant higher accuracy and macro-averaged F1score than with TF-based LSI and LDA.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: probabilistic logicsemanticsinformation retrievaldata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science
Online Semi-Supervised Multi-task Distance Metric Learning,Ya LiDacheng Tao,"2691603534,2661142595","Given several related tasks, multi-task learning can improve the performance of each task through sharing parameters or feature representations. In this paper, we apply multi-task learning to a particular case of distance metric learning, in which we have a small amount of labeled data. Consider the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning handling few labeled machine learning problems, we integrate semi-supervised learning with multi-task learning and distance metric learning. One of the defect of multi-task learning is its low training efficiency, as we need all the training examples from all tasks to train a model. We propose an online learning algorithm to overcome this drawback of multi-task learning. Experiments are conducted on one landmark multi-task learning dataset to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our online semi-supervised multi-task learning algorithm.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: online machine learningstabilitywake sleep algorithmpreference learningmulti task learningrobot learninggeneralization errorcompetitive learningeuclidean distanceprincipal component analysiserror driven learningactive learningalgorithmic learning theorylearning classifier systemsemi supervised learningcomputational learning theoryinstance based learningsupervised learningunsupervised learningpattern recognitionartificial intelligencemachine learningcomputer science
An Empirical Analysis of Hubness in Unsupervised Distance-Based Outlier Detection,Arthur Flexer (Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence),2108214723,"Outlier detection is the task of automatic identification of unknown data not covered by training data (e.g. a previously unknown class in classification). We explore outlier detection in the presence of hubs and anti-hubs, i.e. data objects which appear to be either very close or very far from most other data due to a problem of measuring distances in high dimensions. We compare a classic distance based method to two new approaches, which have been designed to counter the negative effects of hubness, on six high-dimensional data sets. We show that mainly anti-hubs pose a problem for outlier detection and that this can be improved by using a hubness-aware approach based on re-scaling the distance space.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: one class classificationtraining setparticle detectordata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science
SeBPR: Semantics Enhanced Bayesian Personalized Ranking with Comparable Item Pairs,Penghua YuLanfen Lin,"2680505529,2638759883","Learning user preferences from their implicit feedbacks is crucial to enable recommendations in various online applications. The Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) with pairwise preference learning has been reported as one of the most promising algorithms for this problem. It follows a fundamental assumption that a user prefers interacted items to the unobserved items, which feedbacks have not happened. Then in the item pair generation, it either uniformly samples negative samples from unobserved items or incorporate some heuristics for an observed item. This paradigm would obtain noisy item pairs thus lead to a biased solution and a prolonged training period. In this paper, we attempt to enhance BPR with semantics. We first introduce semantically comparable item pairs and elaborate why we should adopt them into pairwise learning. We then present what semantics can be utilized and how can they be modeled. Furthermore, we propose a new method named Semantics enhanced Bayesian Personalized Ranking (SeBPR) to incorporate semantically comparable item pairs into the BPR learning framework. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods could reduce the noisy relationships for learning and thus improve the recommendation accuracy.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: noise measurementsemanticsinformation retrievaldata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

Growing cyber crimes in India: A survey,P. N. Vijaya Kumar (Rayalaseema University),2562105858,"Cybercrime also called Computer crime, is any crime that involves a computer and a network. As individuals and businesses increase their reliance on technology, they are exposed to the growing cybercrime threats. Using the computers for our day-to-day transactions is quite common now a days. For example, we pay our life insurance premium, electricity bills, reserve flight or train or bus tickets, order book or any other product online using personal computer, smart phones, public browsing centers etc. The number of users doing online transactions are growing rapidly ever since, because of the convenience it gives to the user to transact business without being physically present in the area where the transaction happens. Criminals committing cybercrime are also growing day-by-day with the increased number of users doing online transactions. Cybercrime covers a wide range of different attacks such as Cyber extortion, Cyber warfare, spreading Computer viruses or Malware, Internet fraud, Spamming, Phishing, carding (fraud), child pornography and intellectual property rights violation etc. Because of increased cyber-attacks these days, the online users must be aware of this kind of attacks and need to cautions while doing online transactions.

Feature selection for mining SNP from Leukaemia cancer using Genetic Algorithm with BCO,P H Prathibha (Bharathiar University)C.P. Chandran (Ayya Nadar Janaki Ammal College),"2701230573,2667840442","Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of genetic variation in humans comprising nearly 1/1,000 th of the average human genome. The intelligent analysis of databases may be affected by the presence of unimportant features, which motivates the application of feature selection. In this work, we have proposed a genetic based feature selection. Genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection. This heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems. Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Bee Colony optimization (BCO) algorithm is a population-based search algorithm. It mimics the food foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies. In its basic version the algorithm performs a kind of neighbourhood search combined with global search, and can be used for both combinatorial optimization and continuous optimization. In this paper the feature selection approach Genetic clustering with BCO was successfully applied to Leukamia cancer data sets. The feature selection approach has resulted in 80% reduction in number of features. The accuracy and specificity for the significant gene/SNP set was 70% and 82%, respectively. The number of features has been considerably reduced while the quality of knowledge was enhanced.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: meta optimizationbees algorithmcluster analysisgenomicsbioinformaticsdata miningmachine learningcomputer science
Multiobjective linear programming model having fuzzy random variables following joint extreme value distribution,Animesh Biswas (Kalyani Government Engineering College)Arnab Kumar De (Academy of Technology),"2014743537,2095648340","This paper presents a new technique for solving fuzzy multiobjective chance constrained programming problems in which the right sided parameters associated with the system constraints follow joint extreme value distribution. At first the multiobjective fuzzy stochastic model is converted into an equivalent fuzzy programming model applying chance constrained programming methodology and using the properties ofα - cuts. Then using the method of defuzzification of fuzzy numbers the fuzzy programming model is converted into a comparable deterministic model. Afterwards, solving each objective independently, the imprecise aspiration level to each of the individual objectives are obtained. Then the membership function for each objective is defined to measure the degree of achievements of the goal levels of the objectives. Finally, weighted fuzzy goal programming technique is applied to achieve the highest degree of each of the defined membership goals to the extent possible by minimizing under deviational variables of the fuzzy goals in the fuzzy stochastic decision making context. To illustrate the proposed approach, a numerical example is considered and solved.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: fuzzy associative matrixfuzzy transportationtype 2 fuzzy sets and systemsfuzzy measure theoryfuzzy set operationsfuzzy mathematicsdefuzzificationadaptive neuro fuzzy inference systemfuzzy classificationfuzzy numbergoal programmingmembership functionneuro fuzzyfuzzy logicfuzzy setprobability density functionprobability distributionrandom variableprogrammingfuzzy control systemlinear programmingdiscrete mathematicsmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticsmathematics

Prediction of election result by enhanced sentiment analysis on twitter data using classifier ensemble Approach,Rincy Jose (Rajagiri)Varghese S Chooralil (Rajagiri),"2295449036,2326728722","Sentiment analysis is the computational study of opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, views and emotions expressed in text. It refers to a classification problem where the main focus is to predict the polarity of words and then classify them into positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers people a fast and effective way to measure the public's feelings towards their party and politicians. The primary issue in previous sentiment analysis techniques is the determination of the most appropriate classifier for a given classification problem. If one classifier is chosen from the available classifiers, then there is no surety in the best performance on unseen data. So to reduce the risk of selecting an inappropriate classifier, we are combining the outputs of a set of classifiers. Thus in this paper, we use an approach that automatically classifies the sentiment of tweets by combining machine learning classifiers with lexicon based classifier. The new combination of classifiers are SentiWordNet classifier, naive bayes classifier and hidden markov model classifier. Here positivity or negativity of each tweet is determined by using the majority voting principle on the result of these three classifiers. Thus we were used this sentiment classifier for finding political sentiment from real time tweets. Thus we have got an improved accuracy in sentiment analysis using classifier ensemble Approach.

Event logs are freely available in any organization. Business logs are a potential source of useful information. By the various patterns that are present in the logs, a lot can be estimated about the type of procedures that should be incorporated into the organization for better performance. Event logs store information about time and event data of business processes. Process mining algorithms are used to mine business process models using event logs. Generating automated business models out of this could provide valuable insight to a firm eventually leading to customer satisfaction. Process Mining works by three phases: discovery, conformation and alteration. By using process mining, many kinds of information can be collected about the process, such as control-flow, performance, organizational information and decision patterns. A process model could be represented as Petri nets which is a formal graphical representation of the workflow diagram or it can be represented as Business Process Modelling Notation. This project aims to develop a user friendly platform which is capable of generating petri net like models by process mining. By using various process mining algorithms we will develop software which would mine the event logs of a particular firm. It would provide a data or workflow analysis scheme. This would optimize business process intelligence and thus provide alternative and superior work strategies. In this project, we are mainly targeting project management using process mining. There are many projects that are undertaken by an IT company that all follow the same procedure. The concept of business process mining can be used in order to improve the performance of a company by optimizing its Software Development Life Cycle. By feeding the previous logs of a similar project of the company, the software would give a flowgraph. This flowgraph can help to identify the sequence of the activities, roles in the organization as well as various efficiency parameters.

Performance measure of color and texture in visual content retrieval in RGB color space,P S ShimiVince Paul,"2700303710,2662458904",Feature extraction simplifies the amount of information needed to describe the properties of an image accurately. This paper measures the performance of a CBIR system based on texture feature against combination of both color and texture feature. A Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix is calculated for computing the texture feature of an image. Using these textual parameters similar images are extracted from a data set. RGB color space is considered for color feature extraction. Global Color Histogram is generated and calculated color features are represented as one dimensional feature vector. Then we combined both color and texture features to retrieve similar images from the dataset. In both situations Euclidean distance is used to measure the similarity of two images. By this experiment it is found that the system which uses the combination of color and texture has better performance in retrieving similar images from the dataset.,2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: color normalizationcolor balancehsl and hsvhistogram equalizationcolor quantizationcolor histogramcolor depthcolor spaceimage texturecolor imageeuclidean distancehistogramentropyfeaturefeature extractionimage retrievalinformation retrievalcomputer visiondata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Dynamic nature of the MANET requires the modification in routing protocols for performance improvement. This paper presents the detailed survey of strategies involved in the implementation of routing protocols in the MANET. The survey categorized into four phases namely, routing protocols, neighborhood discovery, centralized / distributed hash tables, and bloom filter involved in MANET routing applications. First, the categorization of routing protocols on the basis of various traffic models presents the MANET structure. Second, a neighborhood discovery mechanism conveys the improvement in the routing configurations. Third, application of hash table mechanisms (centralized / distributed) to MANET to improve the matching efficiencies and computational speed. Finally, the application of bloom filter concept to improve service discovery rate and reduce the fake identities. Traditionally, the uncertainty occurs during the prediction of optimal node routing due to the dynamic nature of the MANET. Moreover, the presence of removed malicious node in another cluster degraded the link stability.

An optimal weighted cluster based routing protocol for MANET,Aswathy P Sreevatsan (Rajagiri)Diya Thomas (Rajagiri),"2553496789,2259077521","A MANET is an ad hoc network that can change locations and configure itself dynamically. The link breakage between the nodes due to their movement makes the routing in MANET a difficult process. Grouping the nodes into different clusters can make the task of routing in the network easier. A cluster head is a node present in the geographical region of the cluster and also takes care of the routing and allocation of resources for the cluster members. Nodes register themselves with the cluster head to become members of the cluster. Most clustering algorithms take into account only one factor for clustering. The weighted clustering algorithm takes into account a number of factors such as mobility, degree, battery power and distance to neighbors for clustering process. After clustering the path between any two nodes consists of only clusterheads and gateways of the clusters in the path. This leads to long lived paths between any two nodes. The association and dissociation of nodes to and from clusters perturb the stability of the network topology, and hence reclustering and reconfiguration of the system is often unavoidable. However, it is important to keep the topology stable as long as possible. The clustering algorithm can cooperate with routing algorithm in order to find routes between two nodes. This work mainly consist of three phases. The first phase consist of cleansing the network, which includes identifying the malicious nodes. The second phase consist of the weighted clustering of the network which incorporates a new reclustering condition known as stability factor. The third phase consist of a fuzzy method to choose the best path among the paths available for routing based on the residual energy and mobility of the nodes in the paths.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: ad hoc wireless distribution servicepath vector protocolwireless routing protocolstatic routinghierarchical network modeladaptive quality of service multi hop routingconstrained clusteringlink state routing protocoldestination sequenced distance vector routingoptimized link state routing protocoldynamic source routinglogic gaterouting protocolwireless ad hoc networkroutingpredictioncluster analysispragmaticsdistributed computingmachine learningcomputer networkcomputer science

MANET protocols: Extended ECDSR protocol for solving stale route problem and overhearing,Hridya V DevarajAnju ChandranSuvanam Sasidhar Babu (Sree Narayana Gurukulam College of Engineering),"2566596826,2665293320,2567526251","MANET is collection of wireless nodes which are connected to each other, but all nodes are independent. They can communicate each other via intermediate nodes or directly. In order to increase the lifetime of the network, routing must be energy efficient. Routing protocols like DSR, ECDSR, AODV, TORA, DSDV, EEAODR, and EPAR are proposed for MANET. Design of energy efficient routing protocol is the key issue for mobile ad hoc networks. One difficulty with routing protocols in MANET is to know which protocol performs best in which situation. Since protocols exhibit advantages and disadvantages based on certain context, it is quite difficult to determine. This paper provides an insight into the facts of proactive, reactive and hybrid routing protocols that are used in MANET. ECDSR protocol selects nodes on the basis of minimum threshold energy. As ECDSR protocol has overhearing and stale route problem, which leads to packet loss and over energy consumption.

Improving image retrieval precision using combination of circular reranking and time-based reranking,Sanim SadiqK J Helen,"2563876706,2226182968","Search reranking is regarded as a common way to boost image retrieval precision. The problem is not simple especially when there are multiple features to be considered for search, which often happens in image retrieval. This paper proposes the combination of Circular reranking and Time-based reranking methods for improving the precision of image retrieval. Circular reranking utilises multiple features of an image, usually textual and visual descriptions, for reranking. Initially, it will conduct multiple runs of random walk for obtaining initial search results. Secondly, two features of an image are exchanged for better mutual reinforcement which makes multiple keyword search possible. Lastly, reranked results are attained through exchanging the ranking scores among different features in a cyclic manner. Time-based reranking is based on the count of Time, View and Download, of an image. Time count is the time duration between opening and closing of an image. View and Download counts are the total number of views and downloads respectively for an image. In our approach, Time-based reranking is performed on the Circular reranked list for improving precision, appropriately combining features of both reranking methods, while retrieving images during search.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: visualizationimage retrievalinformation retrievalcomputer visionpattern recognitioncomputer science

LOSP then identifies the local community expanded from the given seeds by seeking a sparse indicator vector in the subspace where the seeds are in its support. We provide a systematic investigation on LOSP, and thoroughly evaluate it on large real world networks across multiple domains. With the prior information of very few seed members, LOSP can detect the remaining members of a target community with high accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that LOSP outperforms the Heat Kernel and PageRank diffusions. Using LOSP as a subroutine, we further address the problem of multiple membership identification, which aims to find all the communities a single vertex belongs to. High F1 scores are achieved in detecting multiple local communities with respect to arbitrary single seed for various large real world networks.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: systematicskernelcombinatoricsdata miningmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticsalgorithmmathematics
Multiple Anonymized Social Networks Alignment,Jiawei Zhang (University of Illinois at Chicago)Philip S. Yu (University of Illinois at Chicago),"2305185572,2125104194","Users nowadays are normally involved in multiple (usually more than two) online social networks simultaneously to enjoy more social network services. Some of the networks that users are involved in can share common structures either due to the analogous network construction purposes or because of the similar social network features. However, the social network datasets available in research are usually pre-anonymized and accounts of the shared users in different networks are mostly isolated without any known connections. In this paper, we want to identify such connections between the shared users' accounts in multiple social networks (i.e., the anchor links), which is formally defined as the M-NASA (Multiple Anonymized Social Networks Alignment) problem. M-NASA is very challenging to address due to (1) the lack of known anchor links to build models, (2) the studied networks are anonymized, where no users' personal profile or attribute information is available, and (3) the ""transitivity law"" and the ""one-to-one property"" based constraints on anchor links. To resolve these challenges, a novel two-phase network alignment framework UMA (Unsupervised Multi-network Alignment) is proposed in this paper. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world partially aligned social networks demonstrate that UMA can perform very well in solving the M-NASA problem.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: evolving networksdynamic network analysisnetwork sciencedatabase indexworld wide webdata miningmachine learningcomputer science

Dense blocks are worth inspecting, typically indicating fraud, emerging trends, or some other noteworthy deviation from the usual.

Traditional approaches represent documents as bag-of-words and compute document similarities using measures like cosine, Jaccard, and dice. However, entity phrases rather than single words in documents can be critical for evaluating document relatedness. Moreover, types of entities and links between entities/words are also informative. We propose a method to represent a document as a typed heterogeneous information network (HIN), where the entities and relations are annotated with types. Multiple documents can be linked by the words and entities in the HIN. Consequently, we convert the document similarity problem to a graph distance problem. Intuitively, there could be multiple paths between a pair of documents. We propose to use the meta-path defined in HIN to compute distance between documents. Instead of burdening user to define meaningful meta paths, an automatic method is proposed to rank the meta-paths. Given the meta-paths associated with ranking scores, an HIN-based similarity measure, KnowSim, is proposed to compute document similarities. Using Freebase, a well-known world knowledge base, to conduct semantic parsing and construct HIN for documents, our experiments on 20Newsgroups and RCV1 datasets show that KnowSim generates impressive high-quality document clustering.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: organizationfeature extractiondocument clusteringknowledge basesemanticstext mininginformation retrievaldata miningpattern recognitionartificial intelligencemachine learningcomputer science
Modeling Adoption and Usage of Competing Products,Isabel Valera (Max Planck Society)Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez (Max Planck Society),"2096884534,2279633593","The emergence and wide-spread use of online social networks has led to a dramatic increase on the availability of social activity data. Importantly, this data can be exploited to investigate, at a microscopic level, some of the problems that have captured the attention of economists, marketers and sociologists for decades, such as, e.g., product adoption, usage and competition. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time probabilistic model, based on temporal point processes, for the adoption and frequency of use of competing products, where the frequency of use of one product can be modulated by those of others. This model allows us to efficiently simulate the adoption and recurrent usages of competing products, and generate traces in which we can easily recognize the effect of social influence, recency and competition. We then develop an inference method to efficiently fit the model parameters by solving a convex program. The problem decouples into a collection of smaller subproblems, thus scaling easily to networks with hundred of thousands of nodes. We validate our model over synthetic and real diffusion data gathered from Twitter, and show that the proposed model does not only provides a good fit to the data and more accurate predictions than alternatives but also provides interpretable model parameters, which allow us to gain insights into some of the factors driving product adoption and frequency of use.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingpredictive modellingcomputational modelmathematical modelmicroscopyworld wide webdata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningsimulationstatisticscomputer science

Though some recent research has studied how to recommend locations with the presence of social network and geographical information, few of them addressed the cold-start problem, specifically, recommending locations for new users. Because the visits to locations are often shared on social networks, rich semantics (e.g., tweets) that reveal a person's interests can be leveraged to tackle this challenge. A typical way is to feed them into traditional explicit-feedback content-aware recommendation methods (e.g., LibFM). As a user's negative preferences are not explicitly observable in most human mobility data, these methods need draw negative samples for better learning performance. However, prior studies have empirically shown that sampling-based methods don't perform as well as a method that considers all unvisited locations as negative but assigns them a lower confidence. To this end, we propose an Implicit-feedback based Content-aware Collaborative Filtering (ICCF) framework to incorporate semantic content and steer clear of negative sampling. For efficient parameter learning, we develop a scalable optimization algorithm, scaling linearly with the data size and the feature size. Furthermore, we offer a good explanation to ICCF, such that the semantic content is actually used to refine user similarity based on mobility. Finally, we evaluate ICCF with a large-scale LBSN dataset where users have profiles and text content. The results show that ICCF outperforms LibFM of the best configuration, and that user profiles and text content are not only effective at improving recommendation but also helpful for coping with the cold-start problem.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: collaborative filteringcollaborationsparse matrixfiltersemanticsworld wide webinformation retrievaldata miningmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics

How to predict these cascades is highly nontrivial in several vital applications, such as viral marketing, epidemic prevention and traffic management. Most previous works mainly focus on predicting the final cascade sizes. As cascades are typical dynamic processes, it is always interesting and important to predict the cascade size at any time, or predict the time when a cascade will reach a certain size (e.g. an threshold for outbreak). In this paper, we unify all these tasks into a fundamental problem: cascading process prediction. That is, given the early stage of a cascade, how to predict its cumulative cascade size of any later time? For such a challenging problem, how to understand the micro mechanism that drives and generates the macro phenomena (i.e. cascading process) is essential. Here we introduce behavioral dynamics as the micro mechanism to describe the dynamic process of a node's neighbors getting infected by a cascade after this node getting infected (i.e. one-hop subcascades). Through data-driven analysis, we find out the common principles and patterns lying in behavioral dynamics and propose a novel Networked Weibull Regression model for behavioral dynamics modeling. After that we propose a novel method for predicting cascading processes by effectively aggregating behavioral dynamics, and present a scalable solution to approximate the cascading process with a theoretical guarantee. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on a large scale social network dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art baselines in multiple tasks including cascade size prediction, outbreak time prediction and cascading process prediction.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: information cascadedata modelingfood additivepredictive modellingsocial networkcomputational modelsocial scienceartificial intelligencemachine learningsimulationstatisticscomputer science

Determining the class labels at such pairs of confusing modes is challenging as the labeling decisions depend not only on the feature values but also on the context of the test scenario.

It has a wide variety of applications in disease diagnosis, neuroimaging, etc. Most research on subgraph mining focuses on the graph representation alone. However, in many real-world applications, the side information is available along with the graph data. For example, for neurological disorder identification, in addition to the brain networks derived from neuroimaging data, hundreds of clinical, immunologic, serologic and cognitive measures may also be documented for each subject. These measures compose multiple side views encoding a tremendous amount of supplemental information for diagnostic purposes, yet are often ignored. In this paper, we study the problem of discriminative subgraph selection using multiple side views and propose a novel solution to find an optimal set of subgraph features for graph classification by exploring a plurality of side views. We derive a feature evaluation criterion, named gSide, to estimate the usefulness of subgraph patterns based upon side views. Then we develop a branch-and-bound algorithm, called gMSV, to efficiently search for optimal subgraph features by integrating the subgraph mining process and the procedure of discriminative feature selection. Empirical studies on graph classification tasks for neurological disorders using brain networks demonstrate that subgraph patterns selected by the multi-side-view guided subgraph selection approach can effectively boost graph classification performances and are relevant to disease diagnosis.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: diffusion mrikernelsoftware testingneuroimagingdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics
Stream Clustering: Efficient Kernel-Based Approximation Using Importance Sampling,Radha Chitta (Michigan State University)Rong Jin (Michigan State University)Anil K. Jain (Michigan State University),"2087785663,2142724104,2162010601","Stream clustering methods, which group continuous, temporally ordered dynamic data instances, have been used in a number of applications such as stock market analysis, network analysis, and cosmological analysis. Most of the popular stream clustering algorithms are linear in nature, i.e. they assume that the data is linearly separable in the input space and use measures such as the Euclidean distance to define the inter-point similarity. Though these linear clustering algorithms are efficient, they do no achieve acceptable cluster quality on real-world data. Kernel-based clustering algorithms, which use non-linear similarity measures, yield better cluster quality, but are unsuitable for clustering data streams due to their high running time and memory complexity. We propose an efficient kernel-based clustering algorithm, called the Approximate Stream Kernel k-means, which uses importance sampling to sample a subset of the data stream, and clusters the entire stream based on each data point's similarity to the sampled data points in real-time. Every time a data point is sampled, the kernel matrix representing the similarity between the sampled points is updated, and projected to a low dimensional space spanned by its top eigenvectors. The data points are clustered in this low-dimensional space using the k-means algorithm. Thus, the Approximate Stream Kernel k-means algorithm performs clustering in linear time using kernel-based similarity. We show that only a small number of points need to be sampled from the data stream, and the resulting approximation error is well-bounded. Using several large benchmark data sets to simulate data streams, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a significant speedup over other kernel-based clustering algorithms with minimal loss in cluster quality. We also demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm by using it to efficiently find trending topics in the Twitter stream data.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: flame clusteringkernel embedding of distributionsk medians clusteringcanopy clustering algorithmvariable kernel density estimationdbscancorrelation clusteringconstrained clusteringdata stream clusteringcure data clustering algorithmsingle linkage clusteringaffinity propagationradial basis function kernelfuzzy clusteringkernel methodk means clusteringclustering high dimensional datakernelcluster analysisalgorithm designmonte carlo methodconsensus clusteringbiclusteringapproximation algorithmdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics

Given a graph G=(V, E) and a set of query nodes Q �xCD; V, we aim to identify the k most central nodes in G with respect to Q. Specifically, we consider central nodes to be absorbing for random walks that start at the query nodes~Q. The goal is to find the set of k central nodes that minimizes the expected length of a random walk until absorption. The proposed measure, which we call k absorbing random-walk centrality, favors diverse sets, as it is beneficial to place the k absorbing nodes in different parts of the graph so as to intercept random walks that start from different query nodes. Although similar problem definitions have been considered in the literature, e.g.,in information-retrieval settings where the goal is to diversify web-search results, in this paper we study the problem formally and prove some of its properties. We find that the problem is NP-hard, while the objective function ismonotone and supermodular, implying that a greedy algorithmprovides solutions with an approximation guarantee.

While graphlets have witnessed a tremendous success and impact in a variety of domains, there has yet to be a fast and efficient approach for computing the frequencies of these subgraph patterns. However, existing methods are not scalable to large networks with millions of nodes and edges, which impedes the application of graphlets to new problems that require large-scale network analysis. To address these problems, we propose a fast, efficient, and parallel algorithm for counting graphlets of size k={3,4}-nodes that take only a fraction of the time to compute when compared with the current methods used. The proposed graphlet counting algorithms leverages a number of proven combinatorial arguments for different graphlets. For each edge, we count a few graphlets, and with these counts along with the combinatorial arguments, we obtain the exact counts of others in constant time. On a large collection of 300+ networks from a variety of domains, our graphlet counting strategies are on average 460x faster than current methods. This brings new opportunities to investigate the use of graphlets on much larger networks and newer applications as we show in the experiments.

To this end, in this paper, we propose a Time-stamped Activity INference Enhanced Predictor (TAINEP) for forecasting next location on activity trajectories. In TAINEP, we propose to leverage topic models for dimension reduction so as to capture co-occurrences of different time-stamped activities. It is then extended to incorporate temporal dependence between topics of consecutive time-stamped activities to infer the activity which may be conducted at the next location and the time when it will happen. Based on the inferred time-stamped activities, a probabilistic mixture model is further put forward to integrate them with commonly-used Markov predictors for forecasting the next locations. We finally evaluate the proposed model on two real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the competing predictors without inferring time-stamped activities.

We introduce to multi-clustering the notion of clustering stability based on Laplacian eigengap, which was originally used in the regularized spectral learning method for similarity matrix learning. We mathematically prove that the larger the eigengap, the more stable the clustering. Consequently, we propose a novel multi-clustering method MSC (for Multiple Stable Clustering). An advantage of our method comparing to the existing multi-clustering methods is that our method does not need any parameter about the number of alternative clusterings in the data set.

Although such an approach simplifies the process of image analysis, it misses the rich context and visual cues that play an important role in people's perception of images.

Using a sample of approximately 1 million posts and 26,000 unique users across four Islamic-based discussion forums, this study proposed a method of identifying the most radical users on the Dark Web. Several characteristics of each user's postings were analyzed using Parts of Speech (POS) tagging, a custom openNLP based tagger, sentiment analysis, and a novel algorithm called ""Sentiment-based Identification of Radical Authors"" (SIRA). POS tagging was used to develop a list of the 400 most frequently cited nouns across the discussion forums. With this list, sentiment analysis provided the context surrounding users' posts, and each post was assigned a polarity value. Radical scores were calculated using SIRA, which is an algorithm that accounts for a user's percentile score for average sentiment score, volume of negative posts, severity of negative posts, and duration of negative posts. Results did not suggest that a simple typology or typologies best described the most radical users in the Dark Web, however, the findings indicated that SIRA was flexible enough to evaluate several combinations of online activity that could identify the most radical users in the discussion forums. In addition, SIRA identified the same user across two separate discussion forums as the most radical, thus providing validation for the algorithm.

Ensemble of Diverse Sparsifications for Link Prediction in Large-Scale Networks,Yi Ling Chen (National Taiwan University)Ming Syan Chen (National Taiwan University)Philip S. Yu (University of Illinois at Chicago),"2574297839,2122365371,2125104194","Previous research has aimed to lower the cost of handling large networks by reducing the network size via sparsification. However, when many edges are removed from the network, the information that can be used for link prediction becomes rather limited, and the prediction accuracy thereby drops significantly. To address this issue, we propose a framework called Diverse Ensemble of Drastic Sparsification (DEDS), which constructs ensemble classifiers with good accuracy while keeping the prediction time short. DEDS includes various sparsification methods that are designed to preserve different measures of a network. Therefore, DEDS can generate sparsified networks with significant structural differences and increase the diversity of the ensemble classifier, which is key to improving prediction performance. When a network is drastically sparsified to 0.1% of the original one, DEDS effectively relieves the drop in prediction accuracy and raises the AUC value from 0.52 to 0.70. With a larger sparsification ratio, DEDS is even able to outperform the classifier trained from the original network. As for the efficiency, more than 95% prediction cost can be saved when the network is sparsified to 1% of the original one. If the original network is disk-resident but can fit into main memory after being sparsified, as much as 99.94% of the prediction cost can be saved.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: predictioncluster analysisalgorithm designapproximation algorithmdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

Temporal Models for Predicting Student Dropout in Massive Open Online Courses,Mi Fei (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)Dit-Yan Yeung (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology),"2282493641,2109477161","Over the past few years, the rapid emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has sparked a great deal of research interest in MOOC data analytics. Dropout prediction, or identifying students at risk of dropping out of a course, is an important problem to study due to the high attrition rate commonly found on many MOOC platforms. The methods proposed recently for dropout prediction apply relatively simple machine learning methods like support vector machines and logistic regression, using features that reflect such student activities as lecture video watching and forum activities on a MOOC platform during the study period of a course. Since the features are captured continuously for each student over a period of time, dropout prediction is essentially a time series prediction problem. By regarding dropout prediction as a sequence classification problem, we propose some temporal models for solving it.

However, it requires an expensive full SVD in each proximal step. In this paper, we show that for many commonly-used nonconvex low-rank regularizers, a cutoff can be derived to automatically threshold the singular values obtained from the proximal operator. This allows the use of power method to approximate the SVD efficiently. Besides, the proximal operator can be reduced to that of a much smaller matrix projected onto this leading subspace. Convergence, with a rate of O(1/T) where T is the number of iterations, can be guaranteed. Extensive experiments are performed on matrix completion and robust principal component analysis.

A personalized POI recommender system can significantly assist users to find their preferred POIs and help POI owners to attract more customers. However, it is very challenging to develop a personalized POI recommender system because a user's checkin decision making process is very complex and could be influenced by many factors such as social network and geographical distance. In the literature, a variety of methods have been proposed to tackle this problem. Most of these methods model user's preference for POIs with integrated approaches and consider all candidate POIs as a whole space. However, by carefully examining a longitudinal real-world checkin data, we find that the whole space of users' checkins actually consists of two parts: social friend space and user interest space. The social friend space denotes the set of POI candidates that users' friends have checked-in before and the user interest space refers to the set of POI candidates that are similar to users' historical checkins, but are not visited by their friends yet. Along this line, we develop separate models for the both spaces to recommend POIs. Specifically, in social friend space, we assume users would repeat their friends' historical POIs due to the preference propagation through social networks, and propose a new Social Friend Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (SFPMF) model.

In this paper, we model the joint evolution of user experience, interest in specific item facets, writing style, and rating behavior. This way we can generate individual recommendations that take into account the user's maturity level (e.g., recommending art movies rather than blockbusters for a cinematography expert). As only item ratings and review texts are observables, we capture the user's experience and interests in a latent model learned from her reviews, vocabulary and writing style. We develop a generative HMM-LDA model to trace user evolution, where the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) traces her latent experience progressing over time -- with solely user reviews and ratings as observables over time. The facets of a user's interest are drawn from a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model derived from her reviews, as a function of her (again latent) experience level.

In an ideal bike sharing network, the station locations are usually selected in a way that there are balanced pick-ups and drop-offs among stations. This can help avoid expensive re-balancing operations and maintain high user satisfaction. However, it is a challenging task to develop such an efficient bike sharing system with appropriate station locations. Indeed, the bike station demand is influenced by multiple factors of surrounding environment and complex public transportation networks. Limited efforts have been made to develop demand-and-balance prediction models for bike sharing systems by considering all these factors. To this end, in this paper, we propose a bike sharing network optimization approach by considering multiple influential factors.

In addition, based on the learned patterns of station demand and balance, a genetic algorithm based optimization model is built to choose a set of stations from a large number of candidates in a way such that the station usage is maximized and the number of unbalanced stations is minimized.

In addition, the cure model has been proposed to model times of death for discharged patients. However, neither the Cox model nor the cure model allow explicit cure information and prediction of patient cure times (discharge times). In this paper we propose a new model, the ""cure time model"", which models the static data for dying patients, surviving patients, and their death/cure times jointly. It models (1) mortality via logistic regression and (2) death and discharge times via Cox models. We extend the cure time model to situations with censored data, where neither time of death nor discharge time are known, as well as to multiple (>2) outcomes. In addition, we propose a joint log-odds ratio which can predict the mortality of patients using the information from both the logistic regression and Cox models. We compare our model with the Cox and cure models on a trauma patient dataset from UCSF/San Francisco General Hospital. Our results show that the cure time model more accurately predicts both mortality and time-to-mortality for patients from these datasets.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelinghazardsurvival analysislogisticspredictive modellingpredictioneconometricsstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics
Top-k Link Recommendation in Social Networks,"Dongjin Song (University of California, San Diego)David A.

In the link recommendation problem, the aim is to suggest a list of potential people to each user, ordered by the preferences of the user. Although various approaches have been developed to solve this problem, the difficulty of producing a ranking list with high precision at the top -- the most important consideration for real world applications -- remains largely an open problem. In this work, we propose two top-k link recommendation algorithms which focus on optimizing the top ranked links. For this purpose, we define a cost-sensitive ranking loss which penalizes the mistakes at the top of a ranked list more than the mistakes at the bottom. In particular, we propose a log loss, derive its surrogate, and formulate a top-k link recommendation model by optimizing this surrogate loss function based upon latent features. Moreover, we extend this top-k link recommendation model by incorporating both the latent features and explicit features of the network. Finally, an efficient learning scheme to learn the model parameters is provided. We conduct empirical studies based upon four real world datasets, i.e., Wikipedia, CondMat, Epinions, and MovieLens 1M, of which the largest network contains more than 70 thousand nodes and over one million links.

Representation Learning via Semi-Supervised Autoencoder for Multi-task Learning,Fuzhen Zhuang (Chinese Academy of Sciences)Dan Luo (Chinese Academy of Sciences)Xin Jin (Chinese Academy of Sciences)Hui Xiong (Rutgers University)Ping Luo (Chinese Academy of Sciences)Qing He (Chinese Academy of Sciences),"2050314250,2499683477,2695402291,2153710278,2291210646,2167314737","Multi-task learning aims at learning multiple related but different tasks. In general, there are two ways for multi-task learning. One is to exploit the small set of labeled data from all tasks to learn a shared feature space for knowledge sharing. In this way, the focus is on the labeled training samples while the large amount of unlabeled data is not sufficiently considered. Another way has a focus on how to share model parameters among multiple tasks based on the original features space. Here, the question is whether it is possible to combine the advantages of both approaches and develop a method, which can simultaneously learn a shared subspace for multiple tasks and learn the prediction models in this subspace? To this end, in this paper, we propose a feature representation learning framework, which has the ability in combining the autoencoders, an effective way to learn good representation by using large amount of unlabeled data, and model parameter regularization methods into a unified model for multi-task learning. Specifically, all the tasks share the same encoding and decoding weights to find their latent feature representations, based on which a regularized multi-task softmax regression method is used to find a distinct prediction model for each task. Also, some commonalities are considered in the prediction models according to the relatedness of multiple tasks. There are several advantages of the proposed model: 1) it can make full use of large amount of unlabeled data from all the tasks to learn satisfying representations, 2) the learning of distinct prediction models can benefit from the success of autoencoder, 3) since we incorporate the labeled information into the softmax regression method, so the learning of feature representation is indeed in a semi-supervised manner. Therefore, our model is a semi-supervised autoencoder for multi-task learning (SAML for short). Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, the feature representation obtained in this model can be used by other methods to obtain improved results.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: autoencodermulti task learningdata modelinglogisticsorganizationpredictive modellingencodingfeature learningsemi supervised learningunsupervised learningdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science

Instead, in this paper, we provide a focused study on automatically mining indecisiveness in massive customer behaviors in online stores. Specifically, we first give a general definition to measure the observed indecisiveness in each behavior session. From these observed indecisiveness, we can learn the latent factors/reasons by a probabilistic factor-based model. These two factors are the indecisive indexes of the customers and the product bundles, respectively. Next, we demonstrate that this indecisiveness mining process could be useful in several potential applications, such as the competitive product detection and personalized product bundles recommendation. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a large-scale behavioral logs of online customers in a distributed environment.

Conventional word vector-basedevent-detection techniques for social media that use Latent SemanticAnalysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or graph communitydetection often cannot scale to such a large volume of data dueto their space and time complexity. To alleviate this problem, wepropose an efficient method for event detection by leveraging afast feature selection algorithm called CWC. While we begin withword count vectors of authors and words for each time slot (inour case, every hour), we extract discriminative words from eachslot using CWC, which vastly reduces the number of featuresto track. We then convert these word vectors into a time seriesof vector distances from the initial point. The distance betweeneach time slot and the initial point remains high while an eventis happening, yet declines sharply when the event ends, offeringan accurate portrait of the span of an event. This method makesit possible to detect events from vast datasets.

Online Model Evaluation in a Large-Scale Computational Advertising Platform,Shahriar ShariatBurkay OrtenAli Dasdan (Yahoo!),"2673155743,2634182670,4321789","Online media provides opportunities for marketers through which they can deliver effective brand messages to a wide range of audiences at scale. Advertising technology platforms enable advertisers to reach their target audience by delivering ad impressions to online users in real time. In order to identify the best marketing message for a user and to purchase impressions at the right price, we rely heavily on bid prediction and optimization models. Even though the bid prediction models are well studied in the literature, the equally important subject of model evaluation is usually overlooked or not discussed in detail. Effective and reliable evaluation of an online bidding model is crucial for making faster model improvements as well as for utilizing the marketing budgets more efficiently. In this paper, we present an experimentation framework for bid prediction models where our focus is on the practical aspects of model evaluation. Specifically, we outline the unique challenges we encounter in our platform due to a variety of factors such as heterogeneous goal definitions, varying budget requirements across different campaigns, high seasonality and the auction-based environment for inventory purchasing. Then, we introduce return on investment (ROI) as a unified model performance (i.e., success) metric and explain its merits over more traditional metrics such as click-through rate (CTR) or conversion rate (CVR). Most importantly, we discuss commonly used evaluation and metric summarization approaches in detail and propose a more accurate method for online evaluation of new experimental models against the baseline. Our meta-analysis-based approach addresses various shortcomings of other methods and yields statistically robust conclusions that allow us to conclude experiments more quickly in a reliable manner.

Clustering with Partition Level Side Information,Hongfu Liu (Northeastern University)Yun Fu (Northeastern University),"2108071053,2123131494","Constrained clustering uses pre-given knowledge to improve the clustering performance. Among existing literature, researchers usually focus on Must-Link and Cannot-Link pairwise constraints. However, pairwise constraints not only disobey the way we make decisions, but also suffer from the vulnerability of noisy constraints and the order of constraints. In light of this, we use partition level side information instead of pairwise constraints to guide the process of clustering. Compared with pairwise constraints, partition level side information keeps the consistency within partial structure and avoids self-contradictory and the impact of constraints order. Generally speaking, only small part of the data instances are given labels by human workers, which are used to supervise the procedure of clustering. Inspired by the success of ensemble clustering, we aim to find a clustering solution which captures the intrinsic structure from the data itself, and agrees with the partition level side information as much as possible. Then we derive the objective function and equivalently transfer it into a K-mean-like optimization problem.

In this paper, we study co-occurrence data using a general energy-based probabilistic model, and we analyze three different categories of energy-based model, namely, the L1, L2 and Lk models, which are able to capture different levels of dependency in the co-occurrence data. We also discuss how several typical existing models are related to these three types of energy models, including the Fully Visible Boltzmann Machine (FVBM) (L2), Matrix Factorization (L2), Log-BiLinear (LBL) models (L2), and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model (Lk).

In consequence, the developed model and its learning method naturally avoid the above difficulties and can be easily used to compute the conditional probability in prediction. Interestingly, our method is equivalent to learning a special structured deep neural network using back-propagation and a special sampling strategy, which makes it scalable on large-scale datasets.

The exact maxima of the quadratic programming problem on the entire graph is approximated by the maxima of the subsets of the graph. Finally, vertices are assigned to the final clusters using a linear game theoretic relation. We also propose the question ""How can a cluster of a subset of a dataset be a cluster of the entire dataset?"". We show that, in the quadratic programming framework, this problem is coNP-hard. Hence, we modify the definition of a cluster from a stable concept to a non-stable but optimal one (Nash equilibrium) that makes it computationally practical to find clusters in graphs with large numbers of vertices. On the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, the proposed method achieves results comparable to the state of the art, providing a parallel framework for image segmentation.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: nash equilibriumgamessymmetric matrixquadratic programmingdiscrete mathematicscombinatoricsdata miningmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticsmathematics

In this paper, we study graph classification where only limited nodes are chosen for labelling by selective sampling. Particularly, we first adapt a spectral-based graph regularization technique to derive a novel online learning linear algorithm which can handle graph data, although it still queries the labels of all nodes and thus is not preferred, as labelling is typically time-consuming. To address this issue, we then propose a new confidence-based query method for selective sampling. The theoretical result shows that our online learning algorithm with a fraction of queried labels can achieve a mistake bound comparable with the one learning on all labels of the nodes. In addition, the algorithm based on our proposed query strategy can achieve a mistake bound better than the one based on other query methods. However, our algorithm is conservative to update the model whenever error happens, which obviously wastes training labels that are valuable for the model. To take advantage of these labels, we further propose a novel aggressive algorithm, which can update the model aggressively even if no error occurs. The theoretical analysis shows that our aggressive approach can achieve a mistake bound better than its conservative and fully-supervised counterpart, with substantially fewer queried times. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on several real-world graph datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our method is highly effective.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: stabilitygeneralization errorkernelpredictive modellingpredictionalgorithm designuncertaintydata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

It is crucial to characterize the disease and the evolution of the ongoing epidemic efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the disease progress and underlying contact network, but suffers from the lack of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance, but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised deep learning framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques. Specifically, this framework learns the social media users' health states and intervention actions in real time, which are regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. Conversely, the learned knowledge from social media can be fed into computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm to substantialize the above interactive learning process iteratively to achieve a consistent stage of the integration.

However, rapid advances in technology make it possible to accumulate thousands of hours of recordings, more than ecologists can ever listen to. Our approach to this big-data challenge is to visualize the content of long-duration audio recordings on multiple scales, from minutes, hours, days to years. The visualization should facilitate navigation and yield ecologically meaningful information prior to listening to the audio. To construct images, we calculate acoustic indices, statistics that describe the distribution of acoustic energy and reflect content of ecological interest. We combine various indices to produce false-color spectrogram images that reveal acoustic content and facilitate navigation. The technical challenge we investigate in this work is how to navigate recordings that are days or even months in duration. We introduce a method of zooming through multiple temporal scales, analogous to Google Maps. However, the ""landscape"" to be navigated is not geographical and not therefore intrinsically visual, but rather a graphical representation of the underlying audio. We describe solutions to navigating spectrograms that range over three orders of magnitude of temporal scale. We make three sets of observations: 1. We determine that at least ten intermediate scale steps are required to zoom over three orders of magnitude of temporal scale, 2. We determine that three different visual representations are required to cover the range of temporal scales, 3. We present a solution to the problem of maintaining visual continuity when stepping between different visual representations.

Order Selection of Autoregressive Processes Using Bridge Criterion,Jie Ding (Harvard University)Mohammad Noshad (Harvard University)Vahid Tarokh (Harvard University),"2618876348,1969126687,418583657","A new criterion is introduced for determining the order of an autoregressive model fit to time series data. The proposed technique is shown to give a consistent and asymptotically efficient order estimation. It has the benefits of the two well-known model selection techniques, the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion. When the true order of the autoregression is relatively large compared with the sample size, the Akaike information criterion is known to be efficient, and the new criterion behaves in a similar manner. When the true order is finite and small compared with the sample size, the Bayesian information criterion is known to be consistent, and so is the new criterion. Thus the new criterion builds a bridge between the two classical criteria automatically. In practice, where the observed time series is given without any prior information about the autoregression, the proposed order selection criterion is more flexible and robust compared with classical approaches.

It is beneficial to many natural language processing tasks, such as Information Retrieval (IR) and document summarisation. Current approaches to text segmentation are similar in that they all use word-frequency metrics to measure the similarity between two regions of text, so that a document is segmented based on the lexical cohesion between its words. Various NLP tasks are now moving towards the semantic web and ontologies, such as ontology-based IR systems, to capture the conceptualizations associated with user needs and contents. Text segmentation based on lexical cohesion between words is hence not sufficient anymore for such tasks. This paper proposes OntoSeg, a novel approach to text segmentation based on the ontological similarity between text blocks. The proposed method uses ontological similarity to explore conceptual relations between text segments and a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm to represent the text as a tree-like hierarchy that is conceptually structured. The rich structure of the created tree further allows the segmentation of text in a linear fashion at various levels of granularity. The proposed method was evaluated on a well-known dataset, and the results show that using ontological similarity in text segmentation is very promising. Also we enhance the proposed method by combining ontological similarity with lexical similarity and the results show an enhancement of the segmentation quality.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: text segmentationontologyvector space modelcluster analysismeasurementsemanticsnatural language processinginformation retrievalpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science

Usually, search providers want to monitor the advertiser communities that share common bidding keywords, so that they can intervene when competition slackens. However, to the best of our knowledge, not much research has been conducted in identifying advertiser communities and understanding competition within these communities. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to detect competitive communities in a weighted bi-partite network formed by advertisers and their bidding keywords. The proposed approach is based on an advertiser vertex metric called intensity score, which takes the following two factors into consideration: the competitors that bid on the same keywords, and the advertisers' consumption proportion within the community. Evidence shows that when market competition rises, the revenue for a search provider also increases. Our community detection algorithm Max-Intensity is designed to detect communities which have the maximum intensity score. In this paper, we conduct experiments and validate the performance of Max-Intensity on sponsored search advertising data. Compared to baseline methods, the communities detected by our algorithm have low Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) and comprehensive concentration index (CCI), which demonstrates that the communities given by Max-Intensity can capture the structure of the competitive communities.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingdatabase indexcorrelationmeasurementdata miningcomputer science

It decomposes multi-label classification into binary (one-vs-rest) classification subproblems, one for each label. The BR approach is a simple and straightforward way for multi-label classification, but it still has several drawbacks. First, it does not consider label correlations. Second, each binary classifier may suffer from the issue of class-imbalance. Third, it can become computationally unaffordable for data sets with many labels. Several remedies have been proposed to solve these problems by exploiting label correlations between labels and performing label space dimension reduction. Meanwhile, inconsistency, another potential drawback of BR, is often ignored by researchers when they construct multi-label classification models. Inconsistency refers to the phenomenon that if an example belongs to more than one class label, then during the binary training stage, it can be considered as both positive and negative example simultaneously. This will mislead binary classifiers to learn suboptimal decision boundaries. In this paper, we seek to solve this problem by learning label specific features for each label. We assume that each label is only associated with a subset of features from the original feature set, and any two strongly correlated class labels can share more features with each other than two uncorrelated or weakly correlated ones.

It is increasingly challenging to digest these reviews for both consumers and firms as the volume of reviews increases. A promising direction to ease such a burden is to automatically identify aspects of a product and reveal each individual's ratings on them from these reviews. The identified and rated aspects can help consumers understand the pros and cons of a product and make their purchase decisions, and help firms learn user feedbacks and improve their products and marketing strategy. While different methods have been introduced to tackle this problem in the past, few of them successfully model the intrinsic connection between aspect and aspect rating particularly in short reviews. To this end, in this paper, we first propose the Aspect Identification and Rating (AIR) model to model observed textual reviews and overall ratings in a generative way, where the sampled aspect rating influences the sampling of sentimental words on this aspect. Furthermore, we enhance AIR model to particularly address one unique characteristic of short reviews that aspects mentioned in reviews may be quite unbalanced, and develop another model namely AIRS. Within AIRS model, we allow an aspect to directly affect the sampling of a latent rating on this aspect in order to capture the mutual influence between aspect and aspect rating through the whole generative process.

We focus on the problem of approximating the degree distribution of a large streaming graph, with small storage. We design an algorithm headtail, whose main novelty is a new estimator of infrequent degrees using truncated geometric random variables. We give a mathematical analysis of headtail and show that it has excellent behavior in practice. We can process streams will millions of edges with storage less than 1% and get extremely accurate approximations for all scales in the degree distribution. We also introduce a new notion of Relative Hausdorff distance between tailed histograms. Existing notions of distances between distributions are not suitable, since they ignore infrequent degrees in the tail. The Relative Hausdorff distance measures deviations at all scales, and is a more suitable distance for comparing degree distributions.

Indeed, students' economic plight negatively impact their mental health, academic performance, as well as their personal and social life. While funding students in financial hardship is widely accepted, there is limited understanding and research on effectively identification of the qualifying students. Traditional approaches relying on advisers' personal assessments are inefficient, and such subjective judgements may not reflect the truth. To this end, in this paper, we explore the data mining techniques for identifying students who are qualified for financial support. Specifically, we investigate students' complex behaviors on campus from multiple perspectives, and develop a learning framework, named Dis-HARD, by jointly incorporating the heterogeneous features to predict the portfolio of stipends a given student should be awarded. Our framework formalizes the above problem as a multi-label learning problem. Along this line, we first extract discriminative features from three perspectives: (i) smartcard usage behavior, (ii) internet usage behavior and (iii) trajectory on campus. Then, we develop a linear loss function with regularization to solve this multi-label classification problem. In addition, to effectively exploit the students' similarity and label dependency, we incorporate the graph Laplacian and composite l2,1-norm into the regularization of our model, and develop are-weighted algorithm to achieve effective optimization.

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Multi-instance Multi-task Learning,Tao Zeng (Washington State University)Shuiwang Ji (Washington State University),"2310544659,2149659377","Multi-instance learning studies problems in which labels areassigned to bags that contain multiple instances. In these settings, the relations between instances and labels are usually ambiguous. Incontrast, multi-task learning focuses on the output space in whichan input sample is associated with multiple labels. In real world, asample may be associated with multiple labels that are derived fromobserving multiple aspects of the problem. Thus many real worldapplications are naturally formulated as multi-instance multi-task(MIMT) problems. A common approach to MIMT is to solve it task-by-task independently under the multi-instance learningframework. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated promising performance in single-instancesingle-label image classification tasks. However, how CNN deals withmulti-instance multi-label tasks still remains an open problem. Thisis mainly due to the complex multiple-to-multiple relations betweenthe input and output space. In this work, we propose a deep leaningmodel, known as multi-instance multi-task convolutional neuralnetworks (MIMT-CNN), where a number of images representing amulti-task problem is taken as the inputs. Then a shared sub-CNN isconnected with each input image to form instance representations. Those sub-CNN outputs are subsequently aggregated as inputs toadditional convolutional layers and full connection layers toproduce the ultimate multi-label predictions. This CNN model, through transfer learning from other domains, enables transfer ofprior knowledge at image level learned from large single-labelsingle-task data sets.

However, two fundamental questions are still open: (i) how to identify regional weather-traffic sensitivity index throughout a city, that indicates the degree to which the region traffic in a city is impacted by weather changes, (ii) among complex regional features, such as road structure and population density, how to dissect the most influential regional features that drive the urban region traffic to be more vulnerable to weather changes. Answering these questions is unprecedentedly important for urban planners to understand the functional characteristics of various urban regions throughout a city, and to improve traffic prediction and learn the key factors in urban planning. However, these two questions are nontrivial to answer, because urban traffic changes dynamically over time and is essentially affected by many other factors, which may dominate the overall impact. In this work, we make the first study on these questions, by developing a weather-traffic index (WTI) system. The system includes two main components: WTI establishment and key factor analysis. Using the proposed system, we conducted comprehensive empirical study in Shanghai, and the WTI extracted have been validated to be surprisingly consistent with real world observations.

Towards Collusive Fraud Detection in Online Reviews,Chang Xu (Nanyang Technological University)Jie Zhang (Nanyang Technological University),"2309108689,2422123818","Online review fraud has evolved in sophistication by launching intelligent campaigns where a group of coordinated participants work together to deliver deceptive reviews for the designated targets.

The present work complements existing studies by exploring more subtle behavioral trails connected with collusive review fraud. A novel statistical model is proposed to further characterize, recognize, and forecast collusive fraud in online reviews.

Besides, we investigate the factors of activity patterns which may be correlated with job change as cause and effect results. First, we quantify the consumption diversity, sentiment fluctuation and geographic movement from the check-in records as indicators.

The Bayesian Factorization Machine [11], with its impressive predictive performance and the convenience of automatic tuning of parameters, has been one of the most successful and efficient approaches within this framework. However, this model has two major drawbacks. Firstly, it assumes that the data is generated from Gaussian distributions that may not be the best assumption for count data such as integer-valued ratings. Secondly, to get the best performance, one needs to cross-validate over the number of latent factors used for modeling the pairwise interaction in FM, a process that is computationally intensive. This paper introduces the Nonparametric Poisson Factorization Machine (NPFM), which models count data using the Poisson distribution, which provides both modeling and computational advantages for sparse data. The ideal number of latent factors is estimated from the data itself, thereby addressing a key limitation of existing approaches to FM.

Reverse top-k queries are proposed from the perspective of the product manufacturer, which are essential for manufacturers to assess the potential market and impacts of their products. However, the existing approaches for reverse top-k queries are all based on the assumption that the underlying data are exact. Due to the intrinsic differences between uncertain and certain data, these methods are designed only in certain databases and cannot be applied to uncertain case directly. Motivated by this, in this paper, we firstly model the probabilistic reverse top-k queries in the context of uncertain data. Moreover, we formulate the challenging problem of processing queries that report l most favorite objects to users, where impact factor of an object is defined as the cardinality of the probabilistic reverse top-k query result set. For speeding up the query, we exploit several properties of probabilistic threshold top-k queries and probabilistic skyline queries to reduce the solution space of this problem. In addition, an upper bound of the potential users is estimated to reduce the cost of computing the probabilistic reverse top-k queries for the candidate objects. Furthermore, effective pruning heuristics are presented to further reduce the search space of query processing.

To enrich trajectory patterns, we propose STS-TPs (standing for Spatial-Temporal Semantic Trajectory Patterns) which refer to the moving patterns with spatial, temporal, and semantic attributes. Given a set of user trajectories, we aim at mining STS-TPs. Explicitly, we extract the three attributes from raw trajectories, and convert these trajectories into semantic trajectory sequences. Given a set of such semantic trajectory sequences, STS-TPs could be viewed as sequential patterns with multiple attributes. To fully explore the efficiency of PrefixSpan on sequential pattern mining, we propose a PrefixSpan-based algorithm (abbreviated as PS) to discover STS-TPs. Note that the input for PrefixSpan is a set of sequences consisting of items. However, each item of semantic trajectory sequences contains three attributes, and we need to further transform these sequences into symbolized sequences before using PrefixSpan. Therefore, we propose two algorithms of Sequence Symbolization (SS) and Advanced Sequence Symbolization (ASS) to achieve this purpose.

Traditional text similarity methods such as tf-idf cosine-similarity, based on word overlap, mostly fail to produce good results in this case, since word overlap is little or non-existent. Recently, distributed word representations, or word embeddings, have been shown to successfully allow words to match on the semantic level. In order to pair short text fragments -- as a concatenation of separate words -- an adequate distributed sentence representation is needed, in existing literature often obtained by naively combining the individual word representations. We therefore investigated several text representations as a combination of word embeddings in the context of semantic pair matching. This paper investigates the effectiveness of several such naive techniques, as well as traditional tf-idf similarity, for fragments of different lengths. Our main contribution is a first step towards a hybrid method that combines the strength of dense distributed representations -- as opposed to sparse term matching -- with the strength of tf-idf based methods to automatically reduce the impact of less informative terms. Our new approach outperforms the existing techniques in a toy experimental set-up, leading to the conclusion that the combination of word embeddings and tf-idf information might lead to a better model for semantic content within very short text fragments.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: explicit semantic analysisencyclopediasemantic similaritymediahistogramthe internetelectronic publishingsemanticsnatural language processingworld wide webinformation retrievalpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

Its economy grew more than 48 times from 1980 to 2013. How are the other countries reacting to China's rise? Do they see it as an economic opportunity or a security threat? In this paper, we answer this question by analyzing online news reports about China published in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the UK and the US. More specifically, we first analyze the frequency with which China has appeared in news headlines, which is a measure of China's influence in the world. Second, we build a Naive Bayes classifier to study the evolving nature of the news reports, i.e., whether they are economic or political. We then evaluate the friendliness of the news coverage based on sentiment analysis. Empirical results indicate that there has been increasing news coverage of China in all the countries under study. We also find that the emphasis of the reports is generally shifting towards China's economy. Here Japan and South Korea are exceptions: they are reporting more on Chinese politics. In terms of global sentiment, the picture is quite gloomy.

To automatically find a good similarity measure from datasets, metric learning and similarity learning are proposed and studied extensively. Metric learning will learn a Mahalanobis distance based on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix, to measure the distances between objectives, while similarity learning aims to directly learn a similarity function without PSD constraint so that it is more attractive. Most of the existing similarity learning algorithms are online similarity learning method, since online learning is more scalable than offline learning. However, most existing online similarity learning algorithms learn a full matrix with d^2 parameters, where d is the dimension of the instances. This is clearly inefficient for high dimensional tasks due to its high memory and computational complexity. To solve this issue, we introduce several Sparse Online Relative Similarity (SORS) learning algorithms, which learn a sparse model during the learning process, so that the memory and computational cost can be significantly reduced.

Modeling of Geographic Dependencies for Real Estate Ranking on Site Selection,Yanjie Fu (Rutgers University)Hui Xiong (Rutgers–Newark),"2168873515,2153710278","With the development of new ways of collecting estate-related mobile data, there is a potential to leverage geographic dependencies of estates for enhancing estate appraisal. Indeed, the geographic dependencies of the investment value of an estate can be from the characteristics of its own neighborhood (individual), the values of its nearby estates (peer), and the prosperity of the affiliated latent business area (zone). To this end, in this dissertation, we propose a geographic method, named ClusRanking, for estate appraisal by leveraging the mutual enforcement of ranking and clustering power. ClusRanking is able to exploit geographic individual, peer, and zone dependencies in a probabilistic ranking model. Specifically, we first extract the geographic utility of estates from geography data, estimate the neighborhood popularity of estates by mining taxicab trajectory data, and model the influence of latent business areas. Also, we fuse these three influential factors and predict real estate investment value. Moreover, we simultaneously consider individual, peer and zone dependencies, and derive an estate-specific ranking likelihood as the objective function. Furthermore, we propose an improved method named CR-ClusRanking by incorporating checkin information as a regularization term which reduces the performance volatility of estate ranking system.

This method first clusters the messages, and then learns the different prediction models from the clusters respectively. The central argument for this two-stage strategy is that the classifiers trained separately from the clustered data sets can focus on particular types of data, reduce the effects of noise, and consequently have an overall higher predictive performance than a single classifier trained from the entire data set.

They have recently drawn much attention with the machine learning and data mining community. Being difficult to distinguish from real examples, such adversarial examples could change the prediction of many of the best learning models including the state-of-the-art deep learning models. Recent attempts have been made to build robust models that take into account adversarial examples. However, these methods can either lead to performance drops or lack mathematical motivations. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to build robust machine learning models against adversarial examples.

Our proposed framework is appealing in that it offers a unified view to deal with adversarial examples. It incorporates another recently-proposed perturbation based approach as a special case. In addition, we present some visual effects that reveals semantic meaning in those perturbations, and thus support our regularization method and provide another explanation for generalizability of adversarial examples.

Nonetheless, this assumption fails to reflect the fact that the importance degree of each associated label is generally different, though the importance information is not explicitly accessible from the training examples. In this paper, we show that effective multi-label learning can be achieved by leveraging the implicit relative labeling-importance (RLI) information. Specifically, RLI degrees are formalized as multinomial distribution over the label space, which are estimated by adapting an iterative label propagation procedure.

Collaborative Multi-domain Sentiment Classification,Fangzhao Wu (Tsinghua University)Yongfeng Huang (Tsinghua University),"2657082348,2666636319","Sentiment classification is a hot research topic in both industrial and academic fields. The mainstream sentiment classification methods are based on machine learning and treat sentiment classification as a text classification problem. However, sentiment classification is widely recognized as a highly domain-dependent task. The sentiment classifier trained in one domain may not perform well in another domain. A simple solution to this problem is training a domain-specific sentiment classifier for each domain. However, it is difficult to label enough data for every domain since they are in a large quantity. In addition, this method omits the sentiment information in other domains. In this paper, we propose to train sentiment classifiers for multiple domains in a collaborative way based on multi-task learning. Specifically, we decompose the sentiment classifier in each domain into two components, a general one and a domain-specific one. The general sentiment classifier can capture the global sentiment information and is trained across various domains to obtain better generalization ability. The domain-specific sentiment classifier is trained using the labeled data in one domain to capture the domain-specific sentiment information. In addition, we explore two kinds of relations between domains, one based on textual content and the other one based on sentiment word distribution. We build a domain similarity graph using domain relations and encode it into our approach as regularization over the domain-specific sentiment classifiers. Besides, we incorporate the sentiment knowledge extracted from sentiment lexicons to help train the general sentiment classifier more accurately. Moreover, we introduce an accelerated optimization algorithm to train the sentiment classifiers efficiently.

Hierarchies in Directed Networks,Nikolaj Tatti (Aalto University),1367500519,"Interactions in many real-world phenomena can be explained by a stronghierarchical structure. Typically, this structure or ranking is not known, instead we only have observed outcomes of the interactions, and the goal is toinfer the hierarchy from these observations. Discovering a hierarchy in the context of directed networks can be formulated asfollows: given a graph, partition vertices into levels such that, ideally, there are only edges from upper levels to lower levels. The ideal case can onlyhappen if the graph is acyclic. Consequently, in practice we have to introducea penalty function that penalizes edges violating the hierarchy. A practicalvariant for such penalty is agony, where each violating edge is penalized basedon the severity of the violation. Hierarchy minimizing agony can be discoveredin O(m^2) time, and much faster in practice. In this paper we introduce severalextensions to agony. We extend the definition for weighted graphs and allow acardinality constraint that limits the number of levels. While, these areconceptually trivial extensions, current algorithms cannot handle them, northey can be easily extended. We provide an exact algorithm of O(m^2 log n) time by showing the connection of agony to the capacitated circulation problem. Wealso show that this bound is in fact pessimistic and we can compute agony forlarge datasets.

Specifically, we aim at investigating the relationship between the patent activities of high-tech companies and the dynamics of their stock price movement. While stock forecasting is a topic of general interest and has been studied extensively in the literature, the most popular forecasting models do not facilitate the discovery of the patent-activity impact all essential characteristics of the market performance of a given stock. To this end, we propose a new approach to analyze the relationships between patent activities and the statistical characteristics of stock prices. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a model of this nature, relating patent data mining and financial modeling. Also, we demonstrate the relationships of the market-adjusted stock returns and the number of patent applications as well as the diversity of the corresponding patent categories. Moreover, we establish relationships between the monthly drift and volatility of the market-adjusted stock returns and those patent activity indicators. Here, we exploit a widely accepted diffusion model of the stock returns and estimate its parameters. By adopting the moving window technique, we create fitted models by introducing various lagged terms of patent activity characteristics. For each company, we consider the coefficients of each significant term over the entire time horizon and perform further statistical testing on the overall significance of the corresponding indicator. The analysis has been performed on real-world stock trading data as well as patent data. The results confirm the significant impact of patent activity on stock movement and on its essential statistical characteristics of drift and volatility.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingfactor analysistime seriesdata miningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

In B2B markets, the buying processes usually involve series of different marketing campaigns providing necessary information to multiple decision makers with different interests and motivations. The dynamic and complex nature of these processes imposes significant challenges to analyze the process logs for improving the B2B marketing practice. Indeed, most of the existing studies only focus on the individual consumers in the markets, such as movie/product recommender systems. In this paper, we exploit the temporal behavior patterns in the buying processes of the business customers and develop a B2B marketing campaign recommender system. Specifically, we first propose the temporal graph as the temporal knowledge representation of the buying process of each business customer. The key idea is to extract and integrate the campaign order preferences of the customer using the temporal graph. We then develop the low-rank graph reconstruction framework to identify the common graph patterns and predict the missing edges in the temporal graphs. We show that the prediction of the missing edges is effective to recommend the marketing campaigns to the business customers during their buying processes. Moreover, we also exploit the community relationships of the business customers to improve the performances of the graph edge predictions and the marketing campaign recommendations. Finally, we have performed extensive empirical studies on real-world B2B marketing data sets and the results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of the campaign recommendations for challenging B2B marketing tasks.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: markov processmarketing researchknowledge representation and reasoningknowledge managementmarketingdata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningstatisticscomputer science
Parallel Hierarchical Clustering in Linearithmic Time for Large-Scale Sequence Analysis,Qi Mao (University at Buffalo)Wei Zheng (University at Buffalo)Li Wang (University of Illinois at Chicago)Yunpeng Cai (University of Florida)Volker Mai (University of Florida)Yijun Sun (University at Buffalo),"2494340745,2679737332,2570154708,2129736985,2309433054,2110420596","The rapid development of sequencing technology has led to an explosive accumulation of genomics data. Clustering is often the first step to perform in sequence analysis, and hierarchical clustering is one of the most commonly used approaches for this purpose. However, the standard hierarchical clustering method scales poorly due to its quadratic time and space complexities stemming mainly from the need of computing and storing a pairwise distance matrix. It is thus necessary to minimize the number of pairwise distances computed without degrading clustering performance. On the other hand, as high-performance computing systems are becoming widely accessible, it is highly desirable that a clustering method can be easily adapted to parallel computing environments for further speedup, which is not a trivial task for hierarchical clustering. We proposed a new hierarchical clustering method that achieves good clustering performance and high scalability on large sequence datasets. It consists of two stages. In the first stage, a new landmark-based active hierarchical divisive clustering method was proposed that partitions a large-scale sequence dataset into groups, and in the second stage, a fast hierarchical agglomerative clustering method is applied to each group. By assembling hierarchies from both stages, the hierarchy of the data can be easily recovered. Theoretical results showed that our method can recover the true hierarchy with a high probability under some mild conditions and has a linearithmic time complexity with respect to the number of input sequences. The proposed method also facilitates an efficient parallel implementation. Empirical results on various datasets showed that our method achieved clustering accuracy comparable to ESPRIT-Tree and ran faster than greedy heuristic methods.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: k medians clusteringflame clusteringhierarchical clustering of networksbrown clusteringcanopy clustering algorithmdbscancorrelation clusteringconstrained clusteringdata stream clusteringcure data clustering algorithmsingle linkage clusteringdendrogramfuzzy clusteringclustering high dimensional datahierarchical clusteringsequencetime complexitycluster analysisalgorithm designconsensus clusteringbiclusteringconceptual clusteringparallel processingbioinformaticsdata miningmachine learningcomputer science

Sequential data is ubiquitous -- financial transactions, advertise conversions and disease evolution are examples of sequential data. A long-standing challenge in sequential data modeling is how to capture the strong hidden correlations among complex features in high volumes. The sparsity and skewness in the features extracted from sequential data also add to the complexity of the problem. In this paper, we address these challenges from both discriminative and generative perspectives, and propose novel stochastic learning algorithms to model nonlinear variances from static time frames and their transitions. The proposed model, Deep Recurrent Network (DRN), can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to capture transitions, or in a discriminative fashion to conduct sequential labeling. We analyze the conditional independence of each functional module and tackle the diminishing gradient problem by developing a two-pass training algorithm. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world dynamic networks show that the trained DRN outperforms all baselines in the sequential classification task and obtains excellent performance in the regression task.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingcomputational modelmathematical modelhidden markov modeldata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer science
Supervised Topic Models for Microblog Classification,Saurabh Kataria (PARC)Arvind Agarwal (PARC),"2596412046,2529782155","In this paper we present a topic model basedapproach for classifying micro-blog posts into a giventopics of interests. The short nature of micro-blog postsmake them challenging for directly learning a classificationmodel. To overcome this limitation, we use content ofthe links embedded in these posts to improve the topiclearning. The hypothesis is that since the link content is farricher than the content of the post itself, using link contentalong with the content of the post will help learning. However, how this link content can be used to constructfeatures for classification remains a challenging issue. Furthermore, in previous methods, user based information isutilized in an ad-hoc manner that only work for certaintype of classification, such as characterizing content ofmicroblogs.

The proposed recommender system consists of three modules including relevance module, quality module and integration module. The relevance module is developed to measure the relationship of an automobile exhibition and a visitor, while the quality module is constructed to analyze the quality of each automobile exhibition. The integration module is to combine two modules above for appropriate automobile exhibition.

In cyber-security applications, however, a key consideration largely ignored in this literature is stealth. In particular, an attacker often has a specific target in mind, but succeeds only if the target is reached (e.g., by malware) before the malicious payload is detected and corresponding countermeasures deployed. The dual side of this problem is deployment of a limited number of monitoring units, such as cyber-forensics specialists, so as to limit the likelihood of such targeted and stealthy diffusion processes reaching their intended targets. We investigate the problem of optimal monitoring of targeted stealthy diffusion processes, and show that a number of natural variants of this problem are NP-hard to approximate. On the positive side, we show that if stealthy diffusion starts from randomly selected nodes, the defender's objective is submodular, and a fast greedy algorithm has provable approximation guarantees. In addition, we present approximation algorithms for the setting in which an attacker optimally responds to the placement of monitoring nodes by adaptively selecting the starting nodes for the diffusion process.

A key element in building predictive models is the ability to introduce features that capture historical user behaviors in an effective manner so as to differentiate between those consumers who are most likely to convert without nurturing, those who are likely to convert with nurturing, and those who are unlikely to convert irrespective of the marketing campaign and channel to which they may be subjected. Towards this effort, we propose to use a set of dynamic features to capture consumers' engagement behaviors. Moreover, we have also applied the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify certain hidden customer behavior patterns and use them as additional features. Various sampling techniques are then explored and compared to address the following three most common challenges faced in dealing with marketing data: 1) severely unbalanced historical ground truth, 2) sparsity in the relevant data due to low historical response rates, and 3) high dimensional due to the large variety of campaign channels, programs or themes. To validate our approach, we conducted some preliminary experiments using real-world campaign data. The evaluation shows that the random oversampling approach has the best performance giving the largest area under the curve (AUC) and an up to 160% improvement in the lift index. Finally, we conducted a pilot with one of our clients over a period of five weeks, which aims to help prioritize the campaign contacts to its consumers in Latin America. As a result, the pilot achieved 74% and 132% of lift in terms of customer responses to phone calls and emails in the test group, as compared to those from the control group.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: direct marketingnon negative matrix factorizationdata modelingpredictive modellingfeature extractionartificial neural networkdata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

In this paper, we consider two online prediction problems for team sports: given a partially observed game Who will score next? and ultimately Who will win? We present novel interpretable generative models of within-game scoring that allow for dependence on lead size (restoration) and on the last team to score (anti-persistence). We then apply these models to comprehensive within-game scoring data for four sports leagues over a ten-year period.

LambdaMF: Learning Nonsmooth Ranking Functions in Matrix Factorization Using Lambda,Guang-He LeeShou-De Lin (National Taiwan University),"2249256204,2114357324","This paper emphasizes optimizing ranking measures in a recommendation problem. Since ranking measures are non-differentiable, previous works have been proposed to deal with this problem via approximations or lower/upper bounding of the loss. However, such mismatch between ranking measures and approximations/bounds can lead to non-optimal ranking results. To solve this problem, we propose to model the gradient of non-differentiable ranking measure based on the idea of virtual gradient, which is called lambda in learning to rank. In addition, noticing the difference between learning to rank and recommendation models, we prove that under certain circumstance the existence of popular items can lead to unlimited norm growing of the latent factors in a matrix factorization model. We further create a novel regularization term to remedy such concern. Finally, we demonstrate that our model, LambdaMF, outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

Twitter Fingerprints as Active Authenticators,Alex Brown (Pennsylvania State University)Myriam Abramson (United States Naval Research Laboratory),"2432786016,2105213678","Leveraging data drawn from the Web, or rather web analytics, has been used to gain business intelligence, increase sales, and optimize websites. Yet beyond the domain of ecommerce that web analytics is typically associated with, authentication based upon user interactions with the Web is also obtainable. Authentication is able to be achieved because just as individuals display unique mannerisms in everyday life, users interact with technology in unique manners. Leveraging these unique patterns, or ""cognitive fingerprints"", for security purposes can be referred to as active authentication. Active authentication stands to add extra security without added burden, as users are allowed the capability to simply interact with technology in their natural manner. Past research on active authentication has looked at areas such as mouse pattern movements, screen tough patterns on smartphones, and web browsing behavior. Our focus here is web browsing behavior. Specifically, we seek to extend past active authentication research done on Reddit. In this research, we examine the ability of Twitter-specific features to serve as authenticators, by examining the behavior of 50 random Twitter users. Through leveraging data mining and machine learning techniques, we conduct three levels of analysis: (1) we survey the ability of Twitter-specific behavioral features from a broad perspective to determine the feasibility Twitter fingerprints as a form of active authentication, (2) we compare aggregated and non-aggregated datasets to determine whether it is better to aggregate user behavior or look at posts individually, and (3) we examine whether certain features are more important for discrimination than others. The first level of analysis suggests that the posting behavior on Twitter follows the power law of human activity and that users can be uniquely identified with a fairly decent level of accuracy. Second, we find that aggregating the data significantly improves F-scores. Lastly, our examination suggests that there is not any specific feature that serves as more discriminative than others.

Reliability search is a fundamental problem in uncertain graph analytics. This paper studies a new problem, the top-k reliability search problem on uncertain graphs, that is, finding k vertices v with the highest reliabilities of connections from a source vertex s to v. Note that the existing algorithm for the threshold-based reliability search problem is inefficient for the top-k reliability search problem. We propose a new algorithm to efficiently solve the top-k reliability search problem. The algorithm adopts two important techniques, namely the BFS sharing technique and the offline sampling technique. The BFS sharing technique exploits overlaps among different sampled possible worlds of the input uncertain graph and performs a single BFS on all possible worlds simultaneously. The offline sampling technique samples possible worlds offline and stored them using a compact structure. The algorithm also takes advantages of bit vectors and bitwise operations to improve efficiency. Moreover, we generalize the top-k reliability search problem to the multi-source case and show that the multi-source case of the problem can be equivalently converted to the single-source case of the problem.

In this research, we compute the correlations between the comments people post in the social soundtrack on various platforms (i.e., Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr) and the terms people search for on a major web search engine (i.e., Google). The broadcast media event for this research is Super Bowl 2015 commercials. Using statistical t-tests, we compare the correlations between the relative volume of searching, obtained via Google Trends, and the relative volume of social soundtrack postings on each of three social media platforms for two temporal phases (Pre and Post) for Super Bowl 2015. We exclude the game day from our research due to insufficiency of granularity for search data on the game day. Research results show that there is no overall significant difference in phase correlation between social media and search data. However, at the individual level, there are brands that do show significant correlation between phases. The number of significant positive correlations between the social soundtrack postings and web search concerning brands are considerably high compared to the number of significant negative correlations in both phases.

This policy generalizes over previous experiments but neither uses a model nor uses meta-features, nevertheless, outperforms the state of the art. We show that a static ranking of hyperparameter combinations yields competitive results and substantially outperforms a random hyperparameter search.

However these neural network based latent semantic models are mostly trained by using simple user behavior logging data such as clicked (query, document)-pairs, and all the clicked pairs are assumed to be uniformly positive examples. Therefore, the existing method for learning the model parameters does not differentiate data samples that might reflect different relevance information. In this paper, we relax this assumption and propose a new learning method through a generalized loss function to capture the subtle relevance differences of training samples when a more granular label structure is available. We have applied it to the Xbox One's movie search task where session-based user behavior information is available and the granular relevance differences of training samples are derived from the session logs.

Weighted Spectral Cluster Ensemble,Muhammad Yousefnezhad (Nanjing University)Daoqiang Zhang (Nanjing University),"2535995844,2132417921","Clustering explores meaningful patterns in the non-labeled data sets. Cluster Ensemble Selection (CES) is a new approach, which can combine individual clustering results for increasing the performance of the final results. Although CES can achieve better final results in comparison with individual clustering algorithms and cluster ensemble methods, its performance can be dramatically affected by its consensus diversity metric and thresholding procedure. There are two problems in CES: 1) most of the diversity metrics is based on heuristic Shannon's entropy and 2) estimating threshold values are really hard in practice. The main goal of this paper is proposing a robust approach for solving the above mentioned problems. Accordingly, this paper develops a novel framework for clustering problems, which is called Weighted Spectral Cluster Ensemble (WSCE), by exploiting some concepts from community detection arena and graph based clustering. Under this framework, a new version of spectral clustering, which is called Two Kernels Spectral Clustering, is used for generating graphs based individual clustering results. Further, by using modularity, which is a famous metric in the community detection, on the transformed graph representation of individual clustering results, our approach provides an effective diversity estimation for individual clustering results. Moreover, this paper introduces a new approach for combining the evaluated individual clustering results without the procedure of thresholding.

Given such constraints, the construction of a national perinatal database has to rely on other patient identifiers, such as names and dates of birth. These kind of identifiers are prone to errors.

Learning Spatial Decision Trees for Land Cover Mapping,Zhe Jiang (University of Minnesota),2310283875,"Given learning samples from a raster dataset, spatial decision tree learning aims to find a decision tree classifier that minimizes classification errors as well as salt-and-pepper noise. The problem has important societal applications such as land cover classification for natural resource management. However, the problem is challenging due to the fact that learning samples show spatial autocorrelation in class labels, instead of being independently identically distributed. Related work relies on local tests (i.e., testing feature information of a location) and cannot adequately model the spatial autocorrelation effect, resulting in salt-and-pepper noise. In contrast, in my recent papers, we proposed a focal-test-based spatial decision tree (FTSDT), in which the tree traversal direction of a sample is based on both local and focal (neighborhood) information. We introduced a focal test approach with adaptive neighborhoods that avoids over-smoothing in wedge-shaped areas. We also conducted computational refinement on the FTSDT training algorithm by reusing focal values across candidate thresholds.

Prediction of Long-Lead Heavy Precipitation Events Aided by Machine Learning,Yahui Di (University of Massachusetts Boston),2646096161,"Long-lead prediction of heavy precipitation events has a significant impact since it can provide an early warning of disasters, like a flood. However, the performance of existed prediction models has been constrained by the high dimensional space and non-linear relationship among variables. In this study, we study the prediction problem from the prospective of machine learning. In our machine-learning framework for forecasting heavy precipitation events, we use global hydro-meteorological variables with spatial and temporal influences as features, and the target weather events that last several days have been formulated as weather clusters. Our study has three phases: 1) identify weather clusters in different sizes, 2) handle the imbalance problem within the data, 3) select the most-relevant features through the large feature space. We plan to evaluate our methods with several real world data sets for predicting the heavy precipitation events.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: windpredictive modellingmachine learningsimulationcomputer science

This paper presents a comprehensive approach to cost change attribution that encompasses a range of factors represented in insurance transaction data, including medical procedures, healthcare provider characteristics, patient features, and geographic locations. To allow consideration of such a large number of features and their combinations, we combine feature selection, using regularization and significance testing, with a multiplicative model to account for the nonlinear nature of multi-morbidities. The proposed regression procedure also accommodates real-world aspects of the healthcare domain such as hierarchical relationships among factors and the insurer's differing abilities to address different factors. We describe deployment of the method for a large health insurance company in the United States. Compared to the company's expert analysis on the same dataset, the proposedmethod offers multiple advantages: 1) a unified view of themost significant cost factors across all categories, 2) discovery of smaller-scale anomalous factors missed by the experts, 3) early identification of emerging factors before all claims have been processed, and 4) an efficient automated process that can save months of manual effort.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: risk poolinsuranceheartactuarial sciencedata mining

For trend detection, high volume events are of interest and the data set is constantly changing. These two problems appear to be very different at first. However, they also have obvious similarities.

In this paper, we propose a Logdet divergence based sparse NMF method (LDS-NMF) to deal with the rank-deficiency problem. In particular, LDS-NMF reduces the risk of rank deficiency by minimizing the Logdet divergence between the product of basis matrix with its transpose and the identity matrix, meanwhile penalizing the density of the coefficients. Since the objective function of LDS-NMF is nonconvex, it is difficult to optimize.

In this paper, we propose Multi-level Approximate Spectral (MAS) clustering to enable efficient analysis of large datasets. By integrating a series of low-rank matrix approximations (i.e., approximations to the affinity matrix and its subspace, as well as those for the Laplacian matrix and the Laplacian subspace), MAS achieves great computational and spacial efficiency. MAS provides a general framework for fast and accurate spectral clustering, which works with any kernels, various fast sampling strategies and different low-rank approximation algorithms. In addition, it can be easily extended for distributed computing.

A Graph-Based Hybrid Framework for Modeling Complex Heterogeneity,Pei Yang (Arizona State University)Jingrui He,"2705969941,2689026536","Data heterogeneity is an intrinsic property of many high impact applications, such as insider threat detection, traffic prediction, brain image analysis, quality control in manufacturing processes, etc. Furthermore, multiple types of heterogeneity (e.g., task/view/instance heterogeneity) often co-exist in these applications, thus pose new challenges to existing techniques, most of which are tailored for a single or dual types of heterogeneity. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel graph-based hybrid approach to simultaneously model multiple types of heterogeneity in a principled framework. The objective is to maximize the smoothness consistency of the neighboring nodes, bag-instance correlation together with task relatedness on the hybrid graphs, and simultaneously minimize the empirical classification loss. Furthermore, we analyze its performance based on Rademacher complexity, which sheds light on the benefits of jointly modeling multiple types of heterogeneity.

In this paper we investigate if incorporating such contextual information into edit distance based approximate string matching can improve matching quality for real-time entity resolution. In this application, query records have to be matched in sub-second time to records in a large database that refer to the same entity.

In addition to the greedy idea, we further present three strategies to heuristically decide the activating timing for each seed. As demonstrated in the empirical study on real data, instead of only providing the flexibility of striking a compromise between the execution efficiency and the resulting quality, these heuristic algorithms can be executed highly efficiently and meanwhile it is able to sustain the longer period which can continuously activate inactive nodes effectively.

Current data mining applications are usually far from fully exploiting the ubiquitous computing power of SIMD instruction sets. Auto-vectorization as performed by most compilers can only be effective if the logical flow of the algorithm supports data parallelism. We consider the wide-spread algorithm K-means as a simple but highly relevant use case for mining vector data. The algorithm SIMD-K-means is a completely re-engineered version of K-means for current microarchitectures with two key ingredients enabling effective vectorization: (1) data-sensitive strategies in order to minimize the information to be transferred to the registers and (2) jointly coding the minimum distance and the best cluster representative which enables a K-means algorithm without any branching. Combined with efficient collection of sufficient statistics for the update of the cluster centers and space-and time-efficient calculation of Euclidean distances by the scalar product, these two ideas provide a substantial speed-up factor of about 5 over standard K-means. Intra-core SIMD parallelism can be combined with approaches focusing on multi-core and distributed environments. Moreover, our general ideas are not limited to K-means but support a wide range of data mining tasks on vector data including classification and outlier detection.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: simdprocessor registerinstruction setk means clusteringcluster analysisalgorithm designparallel processingtheoretical computer scienceparallel computingcomputer architecturemachine learningcomputer science
Accurate Estimation of Generalization Performance for Active Learning,"Aubrey Gress (University of California, Davis)Ian Davidson (University of California, Davis)","2226299968,2560595684","Active learning is a crucial method in settings where a human labeling of instances is challenging to obtain. The typical active learning loop builds a model from a few labeled instances, chooses informative unlabeled instances, asks an Oracle (i.e. a human) to label them and then rebuilds the model. Active learning is widely used with much research attention focused on determining which instances to ask the human to label. However, an understudied problem is estimating the accuracy of the learner when instances are added actively. This is a problem because regular cross validation methods may not work well due to the bias in selecting instances to label. We show that existing methods to address the issue of estimating performance are not suitable for practitioners since the scaling coefficients can have high variance, the estimators can produce nonsensical results and the estimates are empirically inaccurate in the classification setting. We propose a new general active learning method which more accurately estimates generalization performance through a sampling step and a new weighted cross validation estimator. Our method can be used with a variety of query strategies and learners. We empirically illustrate the benefits of our method to the practitioner by showing it is more accurate than the standard weighted cross validation estimator and, when used as part of a termination criterion, obtains more accurate estimates of generalization error while having comparable generalization performance.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: active learninggeneralization errortraining setlabeling theorylogisticscross validationactive learningsemi supervised learninginstance based learningdata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningstatisticscomputer science

Probabilistic Models for Fine-Grained Truth Discovery from Crowdsourced Data,Fenglong Ma (University at Buffalo)Jing Gao (University at Buffalo),"2227076362,2096731881","In crowdsourced data aggregation task, there exist conflicts in the answers provided by large numbers of sources on the same set of questions. The most important challenge for this task is to estimate source reliability and select answers that are provided by high-quality sources. Existing work solves this problem by simultaneously estimating sources' reliability and inferring questions' true answers (i.e., the truths). However, these methods assume that a source has the same reliability degree on all the questions, but ignore the fact that sources' reliability may vary significantly among different topics. To capture various expertise levels on different topics, we propose three fine-grained truth discovery models -- parametric probabilistic model (FaitCrowd), non-parametric probabilistic model and topical influence-aware model -- for the task of aggregating conflicting data collected from multiple users/sources. These probabilistic models jointly model the process of generating question content and sources' provided answers to estimate both fine-grained expertise and true answers simultaneously. This leads to a more precise estimation of source reliability. Therefore, theses models demonstrate better ability to obtain true answers for the questions compared with existing approaches.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: yttriumdata modelingprobabilistic logicreliabilityestimationdata scienceinformation retrievaldata miningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

In an increasingly connected and coupled world, the networks arising from many application domains are often collected from different channels, forming the so-called multi-layered networks, such as cyber-physical systems, organization-level collaboration platforms, critical infrastructure networks and many more. Compared with single-layered networks, multi-layered networks are more vulnerable as even a small disturbance on one supporting layer/network might cause a ripple effect to all the dependent layers, leading to a catastrophic/cascading failure of the entire system. The state-of-the-art has been largely focusing on modeling and manipulating the cascading effect of two-layered interdependent network systems for some specific type of network connectivity measure. This paper generalizes the challenge to multiple dimensions. First, we propose a new data model for multi-layered networks MULAN, which admits an arbitrary number of layers with a much more flexible dependency structure among different layers, beyond the current pair-wise dependency. Second, we unify a wide range of classic network connectivity measures SUBLINE. Third, we show that for any connectivity measure in the SUBLINE family, it enjoys the diminishing returns property which in turn lends itself to a family of provable near-optimal control algorithms with linear complexity.

Measuring Large-Scale Dynamic Graph Similarity by RICom: RWR with Intergraph Compression,Jaekoo Lee (Seoul National University)Gunn Kim (Sejong University)Sungroh Yoon (Seoul National University),"2532697230,2260810702,2226046180","By how much is a large-scale graph transformed over time or by a significant event?' or 'how structurally similar are two large-scale graphs?' are the two questions that this paper attempts to address. The proposed method efficiently calculates and accurately produces graph similarity. Our approach is based on the well-known random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm, which quantifies relevance between nodes to express the structural and connection characteristics of graphs. Intergraph compression, which is inspired by interframe compression, merges two input graphs and reorders their nodes contributing to improved process-data storage efficiency and processing convenience. This is a boon to the RWR algorithm for large-scale graphs. The representation of a graph transformed via intergraph compression can be used to accurately show similarity because sub-matrix blocks are reordered to concentrate nonzero elements. In performing the RWR algorithm, which quantifies inter-node relevance, transformed representation of graph with Intergraph compression is efficient in space requirement and produces results more quickly and accurately over conventional graph transformation schemes.

When learning large hypergraphs, converting them to graphs to employ the distributed graph frameworks is a common approach, yet it results in major efficiency drawbacks including an inflated problem size, the excessive replicas, and the unbalanced workloads. To avoid such drawbacks, we take a different approach and propose HyperX, which is a thin layer built upon Spark. To preserve the problem size, HyperX directly operates on a distributed hypergraph. To reduce the replicas, HyperX replicates the vertices but not the hyperedges. To balance the workloads, we investigate the hypergraph partitioning problem aiming at minimizing the space and the communication cost subject to two separate constraints on the hyperedge and the vertex workloads.

In this paper, we argue that exploiting information about the focus of the document on the entity of interest can significantly improve the task of detecting sentiment relevance and, hence, the final sentiment scores assigned for the entities. In order to assess the value of such information, we look at various methods for detecting sentiment relevance for entities. We consider both rule-based algorithms that rely on the entity's physical or syntactic proximity to the sentiment expressions as well as more sophisticated machine learning classification algorithms. We demonstrate that the focus of the document on the entities within it is, indeed, an important piece of information, which can be accurately learned with super-vised classification means.

Since solar flares are rare events, data-sets for such predictive analysis are inherently imbalanced, causing a bias in the classification. Monte Carlo experiments with randomly sub-sampled, balanced data-sets mitigate classifier biases for imbalanced data-sets, but it is unclear how to implement and interpret feature selection in such a framework.

Redundancy Reduction in Wireless Sensor Networks via Centrality Metrics,Decebal Constantin Mocanu (Eindhoven University of Technology)Maria Torres Vega (Eindhoven University of Technology)Antonio Liotta (Eindhoven University of Technology),"1984519118,2223809055,2106206166","The advances in wireless communications, together with the need of sensing and controlling various nature or human made systems in a large number of points (e.g. smart traffic control, environmental monitoring), lead to the emergence of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) as a powerful tool to fulfill the above requirements. Due to the large amount of wireless devices needed and cost constraints, such networks are usually made by low-cost devices with limited energy and computational capabilities, these further on being subject to easy communication or hardware fails. At the same time, the deployment of such devices in harsh environments (e.g. in the ocean) may lead to uncontrollable redundant topologies which have to be often refined during the exploitation phase of these networks in an automated manner. In the scope of these arguments, in this paper, we take advantage of the latest theoretical advances in complex networks and we propose an automated solution to refine the topology of WSNs by using centrality metrics to detect the redundant nodes and links in a network, and further on to shut down them safely. Our solution may work in both ways, centralized or decentralized, by choosing a centralized or a decentralized centrality metric, this choice being driven by the application goal. The experiments performed on a wide variety of network topologies with different sizes (e.g. number of nodes and links), using different centrality metrics, validate our approach and recommend it as a solution for the automatic control of WSNs topologies during the exploitation phase of such networks to optimize, for instance, their life time.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: key distribution in wireless sensor networkswi fi arraymobile wireless sensor networkvirtualizationcomplex networkwireless sensor networkwireless networkredundancysensormeasurementdistributed computingreal time computingcomputer networkcomputer science

The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we compare the influence of content features on the popularity of tweets for different user categories. Second, we present a regression model to predict the popularity of tweets given the content features as input. To construct this model, we interpolate a generic regression model, which is trained on all data, and a category-specific model, which is only trained on tweets from users of the same category as the user of the given tweet. In this way we can combine the advantage of the robustness of a generic model, with the ability of category-specific models to pick up on category-specific influence of content features. The third contribution is the investigation of the feasibility of boosting the popularity of a tweet by setting up an experiment in which we proactively adapt content features in order to optimize the popularity of tweets.

Finding Hierarchical Communities in Complex Networks Using Influence-Guided Label Propagation,Wenjun Wang (University of Iowa)W. Nick Street (University of Iowa),"2309339408,2097544120","Communities play fundamental organizational and functional roles in various complex network systems. Community detection is an important challenge in network analysis. We approach community detection based on a Shared-Influence-Neighbor (SIN) similarity metric that measures the closeness of a pair of nodes in terms of their mutual influence and the common set of nodes they both influence. In this paper, we present two novel influence-guided label propagation (IGLP) algorithms. One is called IGLP-Weighted-Ensemble (IGLP-WE), in which each node adopts the label of the majority of its neighbors, weighted by the SIN similarity. This simple weighting scheme effectively resolves the significant stability issue in conventional label propagation algorithms. The other is called IGLP-Direct-Passing (IGLP-DP), in which the label is propagated directly from one node to its most similar neighbor step by step. This new label propagation method produces a deterministic partition and requires no convergent iterations. For both IGLP-WE and IGLP-DP, we regard the resultant partitioning as the initial configuration of the community structure. We then perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering to uncover the hierarchical communities at different scales using a new cluster-proximity measure. Extensive tests on a set of real-life networks and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of our algorithms in terms of both quality and efficiency in undirected/directed and unweighted/weighted networks.

In this paper, water level time series, spatio-temporal precipitation and hydrological data are used for flood prediction. Since our data is high dimensional and not all features are correlated to flood, our proposed algorithm is designed to find influential spatial features, or features at locations which are highly correlated to flood. With the idea that true causes, or highly correlated features to flood, should give accurate information about flood, our proposed flood prediction algorithm is based on Bayesian based causal discovery. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we propose a new causal discovery algorithm which is Bayesian-based approach with an optimization function for maximizing mutual information. Secondly, the proposed algorithm is applied to real-world precipitation and hydrological data to find influential spatial features on future flood in North Texas area. Flood prediction models can then be learned from selected features. Experiments on synthetic data confirm that our proposed algorithm is more accurate in finding true causal relationships than two competitors, Group Lasso and Markov2P.

These LBSNs, allowing their users to share personal experiences and opinions on visited merchants, have very rich and useful information which enables a new breed of location-based services, namely, Merchant Recommendation. Existing techniques for merchant recommendation simply treat each merchant as an item and apply conventional recommendation algorithms, e.g., Collaborative Filtering, to recommend merchants to a target user. However, they do not differentiate the user's real preferences on various aspects, and thus can only achieve limited success. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by utilizing and analyzing user reviews to discover user preferences in different aspects. Following the intuition that a user rating represents a personalized rational choice, we propose a novel utility-based approach by combining collaborative and individual views to estimate user preference (i.e., rating). An optimization algorithm based on a Gaussian model is developed to train our merchant recommendation approach. Lastly we evaluate the proposed approach in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and cold-start using two real-world datasets.

We design a market of private data that are gathered towards building a classifier. Each data owner has a private cost that quantifies his discomfort for providing data to the learner. Also, at each stage of the learning process, each data owner is characterized by a utility score, which expresses the utility of his data for the learner. The learner initiates a call for buying data, and interested owners respond by declaring their costs. The learner computes the utility score of each data owner. It then selects one owner to buy data from and associated payment. For the goals of minimizing the expected privacy cost of users and of minimizing the expected payment by the learner, we propose a variation of a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction and an optimal auction respectively. For the case where the data arrive in a streaming fashion, we formulate the multi-round sequential decision version of the problem of learning the classifier. At each round the learner decides whether it will stop the learning process given the current classifier accuracy or perform one more auction. The problem amounts to weighing the current cost of classifier inaccuracy against the expected (privacy or reimbursement) costs incurred through the auction, plus the expected cost of the new classifier accuracy, we cast this problem as an optimal stopping one.

We proposed approaches to infer user interest on Social media where often multi-modal data (text, image etc.) exists. We use user-generated data from Pinterest.com as a natural expression of users' interests. We consider each pin (image-text pair) as a category label that represents a broad user interest, since users collect images that they like on the social media platform and often assign a category label. This task is useful beyond Pinterest because most user-generated data on the Web is not necessarily readily categorized into interest labels. In addition to predicting users' interests, our main contribution is exploiting a multi-modal space composed of images and text. This is a natural approach since humans express their interests with a combination of modalities. Exploiting multi-modal spaces in this context has received little attention in the literature. We performed eleven experiments using the state-of-the-art image and textual representations, such as convolutional neural networks, word embeddings, and bags of visual and textual words.

These courses include different types of assignments in order to evaluate the student's knowledge. However, these assignments are designed to allow a straightforward automatic evaluation. But, in this way it is not possible to evaluate some skills that would require answering open-response questions. Peer-assessment (the students are asked to assess other assignments), is an effective method to overcome the impossibility of having staff graders for this task. Additionally, students gain a deeper knowledge about the subject of the assignments that they have to read critically. However, the grades given by student-graders must be filtered to avoid bias due to a lack of experience in assessment tasks. There are a number of approaches to do this. In this paper we present a factorization approach that in addition to the grades given by graders is able to incorporate a representation of the contents of the responses given by students using a Vector Space Model of the assignments. So we fill the gap between peer-assessment and content-based methods that use a shallow linguistic processing.

The scores obtained by the method presented here were compared with those provided by the staff of these universities. We report a considerable improvement whenever we use the content-based approach.

Exploiting Social Media with Tensor Decomposition for Pharmacovigilance,Christopher C. Yang (Drexel University)Haodong Yang (Drexel University),"2128034517,2145336463","Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a serious health problem all over the world, and how to detect ADRs in an early stage has drawn many researchers' attention and efforts. There are an increasing number of studies focused on this area and many techniques have been proposed to detect ADRs based on various data sources such as spontaneous reporting data, electronic health record, pharmaceutical databases, and biomedical literature. However, these data sources are limited by high cost, under-reporting ratio, privacy issues, or long cycle that publishing a paper in journals could usually take months or even a year. In this work, we propose to detect early ADR signals from social media data. We collected threads of 20 drugs from MedHelp, extracted 14 adverse reactions, either alerted by FDA or added on drug labels, with their alert releasing or labeling revision time being gold standard, and utilize confidence, leverage and lift to identify ADR signals. We also propose to use tensor decomposition to handle the sparseness and missing data in social media. The experiment results showed that both matrix-based and tensor-based approaches are able to detect ADR signals much earlier than FDA's official alert or labeling revision time. Especially, tensor-based method outperformed matrix-based techniques and can better capture temporal patterns.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: pharmacovigilancemediamatrix decompositionstressdata sciencecomputer securitydata miningcomputer science

One approach to address this challenge is to search for subspace clusters, i.e., clusters present in subsets of attributes. Recently the cartification algorithm was proposed to find such subspace clusters. The distinguishing feature of this algorithm is that it operates on a neighborhood database, in which for every object only the identities of the k closest objects are stored. Cartification was shown to produce better results than other state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms, however, which clusters it detects was also found to depend heavily on the setting of the parameters. In other words, it is not robust to input parameters. In this paper, we propose a new approach called ranked cartification that produces more robust results than ordinary cartification. We develop a transformation that creates ranked matrices instead of neighborhood databases, we identify clusters in these ranked matrices.

A thorough evaluation of a drug's effectiveness, side effects, and social and economic influences can prevent serious health damage to the public and shed light on new drug discovery and development. Past research has examined spontaneous reporting systems and electronic health records systems as data sources to study medication outcomes. However, both data sources are not able to provide complete and unbiased pictures of patients' care, making it necessary to integrate new data sources, such as increasingly prevalent social media data. In this study, we compared and evaluated four social media sites, in terms of data coverage and quality using 11 disease-drug pairs of careful selection. We found some patients reported serendipitous new indications for the drugs they were using for comorbid conditions, which is truly valuable information for drug repositioning. We also identified five cases of informal use of English on social media that can be challenging for computers to process, including comparative sentiment, sarcasm, grammar errors, pronoun reference and semantic reference, and emoticons. Our study suggests that social media can be a complementary new data source for studying medication outcomes, and reliable natural language processing and text mining methods are needed to automatically mine social media data on a large scale.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: mediadata scienceworld wide webdata miningcomputer science
Parallel Multi-task Learning,Yu Zhang (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology),2648094648,"In this paper, we develop parallel algorithms for a family of regularized multi-task methods which can model task relations under the regularization framework. Since those multi-task methods cannot be parallelized directly, we use the FISTA algorithm, which in each iteration constructs a surrogate function of the original problem by utilizing the Lipschitz structure of the objective function based on the solution in the last iteration, to solve it. Specifically, we investigate the dual form of the objective function in those methods by adopting the hinge, e-insensitive, and square losses to deal with multi-task classification and regression problems, and then utilize the Lipschitz structure to construct the surrogate function for the dual forms. The surrogate functions constructed in the FISTA algorithm are founded to be decomposable, leading to parallel designs for those multi-task methods. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the convergence of the proposed algorithms is as fast as that of SMO-style algorithms and the parallel design can speedup the computation.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: analysis of parallel algorithmscost efficiencyparallel algorithmlinear programmingtheoretical computer sciencemachine learningmathematical optimizationcomputer sciencemathematics

Hierarchical classification, where each class has a hierarchical relationship, is a typical task in crowdsourcing. However, direct applications of existing methods designed for multi-class classification have the disadvantage of discriminating among a large number of classes. In this paper, we propose a label aggregation method for hierarchical classification tasks. Our method takes the hierarchical structure into account to handle a large number of classes and estimate worker abilities more precisely. Our method is inspired by the steps model based on item response theory, which models responses of examinees to sequentially dependent questions.

Analyzing the Transferability of Collective Inference Models Across Networks,Ransen Niu (Purdue University)Sebastian Moreno (Purdue University)Jennifer Neville (Purdue University),"2277398112,2104332529,2124572662","Collective inference models have recently been used to significantly improve the predictive accuracy of node classifications in network domains. However, these methods have generally assumed a fully labeled network is available for learning. There has been relatively little work on transfer learning methods for collective classification, i.e., to exploit labeled data in one network domain to learn a collective classification model to apply in another network. While there has been some work on transfer learning for link prediction and node classification, the proposed methods focus on developing algorithms to adapt the models without a deep understanding of how the network structure impacts transferability. Here we make the key observation that collective classification models are generally composed of local model templates that are rolled out across a heterogeneous network to construct a larger model for inference. Thus, the transferability of a model could depend on similarity of the local model templates and/or the global structure of the data networks. In this work, we study the performance of basic relational models when learned on one network and transferred to another network to apply collective inference. We show, using both synthetic and real data experiments, that transferability of models depends on both the graph structure and local model parameters. Moreover, we show that a probability calibration process (that removes bias due to propagation errors in collective inference) improves transferability.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: yttriumdata modelingcorrelationpredictive modellingeconometricsdata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

The key is to construct an effective graph to capture the intrinsic data structure, which further benefits for propagating the unlabeled data over the graph. The existing methods have shown the effectiveness of a graph regularization term on measuring the similarities among samples, which further uncovers the data structure. However, all the existing graph-based methods are on the sample-level, i.e. calculate the similarity based on sample-level representation coefficients, inevitably overlooking the underlying part-level structure within sample. Inspired by the strong interpretability of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method, we design a more robust and discriminative graph, by integrating low-rank factorization and graph regularizer into a unified framework. Specifically, a novel low-rank factorization through Semi-Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) is proposed to extract the semantically part-level representation. Moreover, instead of incorporating a graph regularization on sample-level, we propose a sparse graph regularization term built on the decomposed part-level representation. This practice results in a more accurate measurement among samples, generating a more discriminative graph for semi-supervised learning. As a non-trivial contribution, we also provide an optimization solution to the proposed method.

The TOM4L process produces then 12 behavioral models of the white-collar workers of the office, one for each month of the studied period. This sequence of models put on the light the strongly stochastic properties of human behavior since they differ significantly from one month to another. This illustrates the intrinsic difficulty of discovering behavior rules from the timed data provided by a smart environment. Nevertheless, regularities clearly emerges from this sequence of behavioral models that are closely linked with seasons. Two seasons, a cold season of five month and a warm seasons of seven months, are clearly identified with this sequence but to this aim, more abstract models are required.

On the contrary, unlabeled data is usually abundant. Recently, different active learning algorithms are proposed to alleviate this issue by selecting the most informative data points to label. One family of active learning methods comes from Optimum Experimental Design (OED) in statistics. Instead of selecting data points one by one iteratively, OED-based approaches select data in a one-shot manner, that is, a fixed-sized subset is selected from the unlabeled dataset for manually labeling. These methods usually use kernels to represent pair-wise similarities between different data points. It is well known that choosing optimal kernel types (e.g. Gaussian kernel) and kernel parameters (e.g. kernel width) is tricky, and a common way to resolve it is by Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), i.e., to construct a few candidate kernels and merge them to form a consensus kernel. There would be different ways to combine multiple kernels, one of which, called the the globalised approach is to assign a weight to each candidate kernel. In practice different data points in the same candidate kernel may not have the same contribution in the consensus kernel, this requires assigning different weights to different data points in the same candidate kernel, leading to the localized approach.

A Hierarchical Pattern Learning Framework for Forecasting Extreme Weather Events,Dawei WangWei Ding,"2687609582,2680440979","Extreme weather events, like extreme rainfalls, are severe weather hazards and also the triggers for other natural disasters like floods and tornadoes. Accurate forecasting of such events relies on the understanding of the spatiotemporal evolution processes in climate system. Learning from climate science data has been a challenging task, because the variations among spatial, temporal and multivariate spaces have created a huge amount of features and complex regularities within the data. In this study we developed a framework for learning patterns from the spatiotemporal system and forecasting extreme weather events. In this framework, we learned patterns in a hierarchical manner: in each level, new features were learned from data and used as the input for the next level. Firstly, we summarized the temporal evolution process of individual variables by learning the location-based patterns. Secondly, we developed an optimization algorithm for summarizing the spatial regularities, SCOT, by growing spatial clusters from the location-based patterns. Finally, we developed an instance-based algorithm, SPC, to forecast the extreme events through classification. We applied this framework to forecasting extreme rainfall events in the eastern Central Andes area. Our experiments show that this method was able to find climatic process patterns similar to those found in domain studies, and our forecasting results outperformed the state-of-art model.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: spatiotemporal databasepredictive modellingforecastingcluster analysisdata miningmachine learningcomputer science

Email Engagement Segmentation Using Bipartite Graph Co-clustering,Ketong Wang (University of Alabama)Aaron Beach,"2643318645,2631124965","In the industry of email marketing, it is important to send content relevant to the recipient. If the recipients are uninterested they may ignore the email or worse report it as spam. Such actions compromise the ability of the senders to deliver emails to the inboxes of other recipients and permanently harm their relationship with the uninterested recipients. Targeting highly engaged recipients with appropriate content helps senders maximize the value of their email marketing efforts. Traditional research on email recipient engagement has focused on identifying topic groups through text mining and sentiment analysis. In this paper, we investigate recipient engagement via co-clustering methods on graphs of sender-recipient engagement built from email opens and clicks on URL links. We study a real engagement graph from marketing emails sent over SendGrid in May of 2015. We find that the sender-recipient engagement graph has a self-similar or recurring dominant co-cluster structure and the minor co-clusters are paired as engagement contrasts. Additionally, we find that these co-clusters persist across subsequent months implying that this approach may be useful for predicting recipient engagement behavior within clusters.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: html emailbipartite graphcluster analysisinternet privacyworld wide webdata miningmachine learningcomputer science

It points out that the statistic features of human behaviors with acquainted objects and unacquainted objects need to be considered independently. Based on research in these two data sets, the timing of human behaviors is a combination of the heavy tail distribution for time interval of executing acquainted objects and the quasi uniform distribution for initial time of executing unacquainted objects.

Jackknifing Documents and Additive Smoothing for Naive Bayes with Scarce Data,Vinay Deolalikar (Hewlett-Packard),2150307071,"Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers are well-suited to several applications owing to their easy interpretability and maintainability.

Our approachjackknifes documents themselves to create new ""pseudo-documents."" Theunderlying idea is that although these pseudo-documents do not havesemantic meaning, they are equally representative of the underlyingdistribution of terms. Therefore, they could be used to train any classifierthat learns this underlying distribution, namely, any parametric classifiersuch as NB (but not, for example, non-parametric classifiers such as SVMand k-NN). Furthermore, the marginal value of this additional trainingdata should be the highest precisely when the original data is inadequate. We then show that our jackknife technique is related to the questionof additively smoothing NB via an appropriately defined notion of""adjointness."" This relation is surprising since it connects a statisticaltechnique for handling scarce data to a question about the NB model. Accordingly, we are able to shed light on optimal values of the smoothingparameter for NB in the very scarce data regime. We validate our approach on a wide array of standard benchmarks -- both binary and multi-class -- for two event models of multinomial NB. Weshow that the jackknife technique can dramatically improve the accuracyfor both event models of NB in the regime of very scarce training data.

Their popularity is due to their ability to achieve higher accuracy than conventional machine learning in many research areas such as speech recognition, image processing and natural language processing.

However, deep learning algorithms require a large amount of computational power and significant amount of time to train. Fortunately, the training and inference algorithms of deep learning architectures expose abundant data-parallelism.

Factors affecting the investigation of bird species richness include weather, observation bias, and most importantly, the prohibitive costs of conducting surveys at large spatiotemporal scales. Thanks to advances in recording techniques, these problems have been alleviated by deploying sensors for acoustic data collection. Although automated detection techniques have been introduced to identify various bird species, the innate complexity of bird vocalizations, the background noise present in the recording and the escalating volumes of acoustic data pose a challenging task on determination of bird species richness. In this paper we proposed a two-step computer-assisted sampling approach for determining bird species richness in one-day acoustic data. First, a classification model is built based on acoustic indices for filtering out minutes that contain few bird species.

Specifically, we propose a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator to detect the information source for general graphs with rumor centrality as the prior. To further improve the efficiency, we design two approximate estimators, namely Brute Force Search Approximation (BFSA) and Greedy Search Bound Approximation (GSBA). BFSA tries to traverse the permitted permutations and directly computes the likelihood, while GSBA exploits a strategy of greedy search to find a surrogate upper bound of the probabilities of permitted permutations for a given node, and derives an approximate MAP estimator.

This paper introduces a method for sparsecoding of bioacoustic recordings in order to efficiently compress and automatically extract patterns in data. We demonstrate the proposed method on the analysis of humpback whale songs. Previous work suggests that the structure of these songs can be characterized by successive vocalizations called sound units. Most of these analyses are currently done with expert intervention, but the volume of recordings drive the need for automated methods for sound unit classification. This paper proposes that sparse coding of the song at different time scales supports the distinction of stable song components versus those which evolve year to year. The approach is summarized as: first, an unsupervised method is used to encode the entire bioacoustic dataset into a dictionary, second, sparse coding is used to limit the number of elements in the dictionary, third, salientfeatures are identified using the Lasso algorithm, and finally, an interpretation of the evolving and stable components of the songs is derived, supporting an analysis of year to year variation. It is shown that shorter codes are more stable, occurring with similar frequency across two consecutive years, while the occurrence of longer units varies across years as expected based on the prior manual analysis. 250 ms segments appear to be an appropriate length for encoding stable features of whale songs, possibly corresponding to subunits. We conclude by exploring further possibilities of the application of this method for biopopulation analysis.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: bioacousticsneural codingencodingspeech recognitiondata miningcomputer science

Important characteristics of this type of framework include accuracy, efficiency and extensibility. The objective of this work is to build an initial implementation of such a framework within a big data paradigm. To this end, a clinical data warehouse was built for the structured data and a set of modules were created to analyze the unstructured content. The framework contains built-in modules but is flexible in allowing the user to import their own, making it extensible. Furthermore, the framework runs the modules in a Hadoop cluster making it efficient by utilizing the distributed computing capability of big data approach.

The problem of ATM location is further complicated as customers of one bank can use their debit cards at any other bank's ATMs. While this might attract charges, some banks often refund these charges to attract customers. Banks need to have a mechanism to quantitatively measure the benefits of managing their own ATM versus paying for services rendered to it's customers by other banks through their ATMs. Game theory is the study of strategic decision making and is an effective technique to identify the best business strategy when provided with multiple options. In this paper we propose a game theoretic model based on stochastic games to identify the best strategy to be adopted by banks for their ATM expansion. We further propose an algorithm to identify the idle locations where a bank should place an ATM should the result of the ATM game recommend that the bank should establish it's own ATM.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: gameswireless sensor networkwirelessgame theoryactuarial sciencesimulationstatisticscomputer science

Most previous methods for subspace analysis learn onlyone subspace, failing to discover the intrinsic complex structure, while state-of-the-art methods use data itself as the basis (self-expressiveness property), showing degraded performance whendata contain errors. To tackle the problem, we propose anovel method, called Matrix Factorization with Column L0-normconstraint (MFC0), from the matrix factorization perspective. MFC0 simultaneously discovers the multi-subspace structure ofeither clean or contaminated data, and learns the basis for eachsubspace. Speciflcally, the learnt basis with the orthonormal constraint shows high robustness to errors by adding a regularizationterm. Owing to the column l0-norm constraint, the generatedrepresentation matrix can be (approximate) block-diagonal afterreordering its columns, with each block characterizing onesubspace. We develop an efflcient flrst-order optimization schemeto stably solve the nonconvex and nonsmooth objective function ofMFC0.

Identifying Behavioral Characteristics in EGM Gambling Data Using Session Clustering,Maria Gabriella Mosquera (Dalhousie University)Vlado Keelj (Dalhousie University),"2278861068,2269952389","The rising accessibility and popularity of gambling products has increased interest in the effects of gambling. Nonetheless, research of gambling measures is scarce. This paper presents the application of data mining techniques, on 46,514 gambling sessions, to distinguish types of gambling and identify potential instances of problem gambling in EGMs. Gambling sessions included measures of gambling involvement, out-of-pocket expense, winnings and cost of gambling. In this first exploratory study, sessions were clustered into four clusters, as a stability test determined four clusters to be the most high-quality yielding and stable solution within our clustering criteria. Based on the expressed gambling behavior within these sessions, our k-means cluster analysis results indicated sessions were classified as potential non-problem gambling sessions, potential low risk gambling sessions, potential moderate risk gambling sessions, and potential problem gambling sessions. While the complexity of EGM data prevents researchers from recognizing the incidence of problem gambling in a specific individual, our methods suggest that the lack of player identification does not prevent one from identifying the incidence of problem gambling behavior.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: communications protocolthe internetdata miningcomputer science

Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods are being developed to help improve the ability of clinical radiologists to detect and diagnose malignant lung nodules. While many research studies use low-level image features to predict malignancy, only few CAD systems look into integrating semantic data (such as spiculation, subtlety and margin characteristics) in these systems. The availability of these semantic characteristics in the NIH/NCI Lung Nodule Database Consortium (LIDC) creates new opportunities to explore the relationships among these semantic characteristics in the context of lung nodule diagnostic interpretation. We propose the use of Association Rule Mining (ARM) to quantify these relationships and introduce new evaluation metrics that relate to the importance of individual characteristics rather than to a set of rules as a whole.

Given some nodes' labels (i.e., the sources), the task is to infer some other nodes' labels (i.e., the targets) in the same network. Relational classification methods, which leverage the correlation of labels between linked instances, have been shown to outperform traditional classifiers. However, typical relational classification methods make predictions about targets by executing collective inference over the full set of unlabeled nodes, and then to get the labels of targets. In large-scale social network environments, when we want to predict only a specific node's labels, collective inference procedure can seriously limit the efficiency of relational classifiers and make it inapplicable to large-scale social networks. In this paper, we first propose a new concept Core Network which is composed of the shortest paths that link sources and targets. These paths have the most significant influence on classification. Then we propose a novel Heuristic Core Network discovery (i.e., HCN) algorithm to discover the core network. Finally, we propose two classification algorithms HCN-wvRN and HCN-SCRN. Both algorithms are capable of handling large-scale social networks in an efficient way. The difference between two algorithms is HCN-wvRN consumes much less time than existing methods, while HCN-SCRN can achieve higher classification accuracy than HCN-wvRN.

Fast Keypoint Reduction for Image Retrieval by Accelerated Diverse Density Computation,Toshikazu Wada (Wakayama University)Yuichi Mukai (Wakayama University),"2105847832,2281662021","Through many researches on CBIR (Content Based Image Retrieval), local image features defined on keypoints are proved to be effective for occlusion-robust image retrieval. However, not all features in an image contribute correct image retrieval, i.e. some are unstable and some commonly appear in other images. For representing the importance of the image features, Diverse Density (DD) based index-feature reduction has been proposed[13], which reduces the elapsed time, as well as the number of erroneous retrievals. The only drawback of this method is low computational efficiency: it requires distance computations between all possible combinations of local features for computing RBF kernel. Because of this problem, the DD based keypoint reduction cannot be applied to a large scale image database. This paper presents an acceleration method of DD computation by applying Range Nearest Neighbor (RNN) search for gathering the proximal features to a given point in the feature space. This is because the distant points from the point in the feature space are believed to have negligible influence to the DD value at that point. We proposed two types of acceleration methods, one has a single index structure for the radius search and the other has multiple indices defined on single images. We applied our method to Nister's data set and achieved 520-times speedup over the original method.

Enhancing Network Security by Software Vulnerability Detection Using Social Media Analysis Extended Abstract,Dennis Kergl,2627468537,"Detecting attacks that are based on unknown security vulnerabilities is a challenging problem. The timely detection of attacks based on hitherto unknown vulnerabilities is crucial for protecting other users and systems from being affected as well. To know the attributes of a novel attack's target system can support automated reconfiguration of firewalls and sending alerts to administrators of other vulnerable targets. We suggest a novel approach of post-incident intrusion detection by utilizing information gathered from real-time social media streams. To accomplish this we take advantage of social media users posting about incidents that affect their user accounts of attacked target systems or their observations about misbehaving online services. Combining knowledge of the attacked systems and reported incidents, we should be able to recognize patterns that define the attributes of vulnerable systems. By matching detected attribute sets with those attributes of well-known attacks, we furthermore should be able to link attacks to already existing entries in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. If a link to an existing entry is not found, we can assume to have detected an exploitation of an unknown vulnerability, i.e., a zero day exploit or the result of an advanced persistent threat. This finding could also be used to direct efforts of examining vulnerabilities of attacked systems and therefore lead to faster patch deployment.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: vulnerability managementintrusion prevention systemmediaintrusion detection systemweb serviceinternet privacyworld wide webcomputer securitydata miningcomputer science
Multi-Classes Feature Engineering with Sliding Window for Purchase Prediction in Mobile Commerce,Qiang LiMaojie GuKeren ZhouXiaoming Sun,"2637175533,2280343506,2548292797,2702009051","Mobile devices become more and more prevalent in recent years, especially in young groups. The rapid progress of mobile devices promotes the development of M-Commerce business. The purchase on mobile terminals accounts for a considerable percentage in the total trading volume of E-Commerce and begins to draw the attention of E-Commerce corporation. Alibaba held a Mobile Recommendation Algorithm Competition aiming to recommend appropriate items for mobile users at the right time and place. The dataset provided by Alibaba consists of about 6 billion operation logs made by 5 million Taobao users towards over 150 million items spanning a period of one month. Compared with traditional scenarios in purchase predicting, the competition raised three challenges: (1)The dataset is too large to be processed in personal computers, (2)Some days with great discounts provided by Taobao Marketplace are within the period of dataset, (3)Positive samples are too few compared to the dimension of features. In this paper we study the problem of predicting the purchase behaviour of M-Commerce users, by exploring the solution for Alibaba's Mobile Recommendation Algorithm Competition. We first deeply study the habit of customers and filter many outliers. After that we adopt the method of ""sliding window"" to supply positive samples of training dataset and smooth the burst of sales near Dec 12th. We design a feature engineering framework to extract 6 categories of features that aim to capture the buying potential of user-item pairs. Our features exploit the interaction of user-item pair, user's shopping habit and item' attraction for users. Then we apply Gradient Boost Decision Trees (GBDT) as the training model.

Toponym Recognition in Social Media for Estimating the Location of Events,Meryem SagcanPinar Karagoz,"2281493922,2723117309","Prominence of social media such as Twitter and Facebook led to a huge collection of data over which event detection provides useful results. An important dimension of event detection is location estimation for detected events. Social media provides a variety of clues for location, such as geographical annotation from smart devices, location field in the user profileand the content of the message. Among these clues, message content needs more effort for processing, yet it is generally more informative. In this paper, we focus on extraction of location names, i.e., toponym recognition, from social media messages.

However, in many real applications, to provide instance level label is still costly. Thus, weakly supervised approach is proposed and naturally cast as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. Traditional MIL methods typically learn discriminative classifiers from positive and negative training bags. Alternatively, we propose to select more discriminative instances for learning classifiers to further improve detection accuracy. With the candidate set of positive instances, we can also train a Smoothing Latent Support Vector Machine (SLSVM) to finally detect objects from a bag of instances. We observed that object instances of a common category are visually similar and when characterized as high-dimensional feature representations, they approximately lie in a low-dimensional subspace. Therefore, we propose a formulation optimizes a labeling variable for each positive image and learns the subspace model by minimizing rank (via convex surrogate function) of the coefficient matrix associated with the subspace model. To improve discriminative power, we also promote incoherence between the subspace model and some ""hard"" negative instances by utilizing a ε-insensitive loss. For this non-convex problem, we resort to block coordinate descent and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM) to get local optimal solutions.

Secure Learning and Mining in Adversarial Environments [Extended Abstract],Bo Li,2444252933,"Machine learning and data mining have become ubiquitous tools in modern computing applications and large enterprise systems benefit from its adaptability and intelligent ability to infer patterns that can be used for prediction or decision-making. Great success has been achieved by applying machine learning and data mining to the security settings for large dataset, such as in intrusion detection, virus detection, biometric identity recognition, and spam filtering. However, the strengths of the learning systems, such as the adaptability and ability to infer patterns, can also become their vulnerabilities when there are adversarial manipulations during the learning and predicting process. Considering the fact that the traditional learning strategies could potentially introduce security faults into the learning systems, robust machine learning techniques against the sophisticated adversaries need to be studied, which is referred to as secure learning and mining through this abstract. Based on the goal of secure learning and mining, I aim to analyze the behavior of learning systems in adversarial environments by studying different kinds of attacks against the learning systems. Then design robust learning algorithms to counter the corresponding malicious behaviors based on the evaluation and prediction of the adversaries' goal and capabilities.

As a growing hub of tourism and culture, this could be particularly useful to the country. However, a large amount of this data has gone unanalyzed. This study discusses and develops a way that could help bridge that gap using automated tourism-related tweet identification with Support Vector Machines and sentiment analysis with Naive Bayes. F-scores of 0.943 and 0.81 were obtained by these components respectively, with the overall system obtaining an accuracy of 84%. Mapbox was used for visualization, with tweets plotted based on their geolocations and sentiments.

Ranking-Based Multi-source Rating Aggregation with Social Contexts,Lei Li (Hefei University of Technology)Qin Liang (Hefei University of Technology)Guanfeng Liu (Soochow University),"2649073345,2476787905,2686765549","Rating aggregation is critical to the quality control of recommendation systems and its effectiveness is a deep concern of all users. However, there are some problems in existing recommendation systems. For example, some of the raters from certain source are much more stringent than others, leading the phenomena that some entities with better quality are rejected. In this paper, we propose a novel raNking-based multI-source ratiNg Aggregation (NINA) approach. In this approach, based on the collected social context of recommenders and recommendees, the credibility of rankings of ratings from multiple sources can be estimated, and it can be used to deal with the disagreement during ranking-based rating aggregation from multiple sources. Hence, the proposed approach can effectively estimate the 'true' rating during aggregation based on the ratings from multiple sources, even though no prior knowledge exists about the distribution of stringent raters and lenient raters in different sources. We have studied the properties of NINA empirically. In particular, the experiments illustrate that compared with existing approaches, our proposed NINA can significantly reduce the influence of ratings from stringent raters and lenient raters, leading to trust enhanced rating aggregation, no matter what kind of the distributions of stringent raters and lenient raters are.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: rankingcollaborationinformation technologyworld wide webdata miningcomputer sciencemathematics
Finding Event Videos via Image Search Engine,Han Wang (Beijing Forestry University)Xinxiao Wu (Beijing Institute of Technology),"2563220676,2682314339","Searching desirable events in uncontrolled videos isa challenging task. Current researches mainly focus on obtaining concepts from numerous labeled videos. But it is time consumingand labor expensive to collect a large amount of required labeled videos to model events under various circumstances. To alleviate the labeling process, we propose to learn models for videos by leveraging abundant Web images which contains a rich source of information with many events taken under various conditions and roughly annotated. However, knowledge from the Web is noisy and diverse, brute force knowledge transfer may hurt the retrieval performance. To address such negative transfer problem, we propose a novel Joint Group Weighting Learning (JGWL) framework to leverage different but related groups of knowledge (source domain) queried from the Web image searching engine to real-world videos (target domain). Under this framework, weights of different groups are learned in a joint optimization framework, and each weight represents how contributive the corresponding image group is to the knowledge transferred to the videos. Moreover, to deal with the feature distribution mismatching between video feature space and image feature space, we build a common feature subspace to bridge these two heterogeneous feature spaces in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results on two challenging video datasets demonstrate that it is effective to use grouped knowledge gained from Web images for video retrieval.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: transfer of learningcorrelationknowledge engineeringmultimediaworld wide webcomputer visiondata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics
Defending Suspected Users by Exploiting Specific Distance Metric in Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems,Zhihai Yang (Xi'an Jiaotong University)zhongmin Cai (Xi'an Jiaotong University),"2708440485,2666103064","Collaborative filtering recommender systems (CFRSs) are critical components of existing popular e-commerce websites to make personalized recommendations. In practice, CFRSs are highly vulnerable to ""shilling"" attacks or ""profile injection"" attacks due to its openness. A number of detection methods have been proposed to make CFRSs resistant to such attacks. However, some of them distinguished attackers by using typical similarity metrics, which are difficult to fully defend all attackers and show high computation time, although they can be effective to capture the concerned attackers in some extent. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to detect such attacks. Firstly, we filter out more genuine users by using suspected target items as far as possible in order to reduce time consumption. Based on the remained result of the first stage, we employ a new similarity metric to further filter out the remained genuine users, which combines the traditional similarity metric and the linkage information between users to improve the accuracy of similarity of users.

Incremental Discriminant Learning for Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation,Peng HanXinxiao Wu (Beijing Institute of Technology),"2309844953,2682314339","This paper proposes a new incremental learning method for heterogeneous domain adaptation, in which the training data from both source domain and target domains are acquired sequentially, represented by heterogeneous features. Two different projection matrices are learned to map the data from two domains into a discriminative common subspace, where the intra-class samples are closely-related to each other, the inter-class samples are well-separated from each other, and the data distribution mismatch between the source and target domains is reduced. Different from previous work, our method is capable of incrementally optimizing the projection matrices when the training data becomes available as a data stream instead of being given completely in advance. With the gradually coming training data, the new projection matrices are computed by updating the existing ones using an eigenspace merging algorithm, rather than repeating the learning from the begin by keeping the whole training data set. Therefore, our incremental learning solution for the projection matrices can significantly reduce the computational complexity and memory space, which makes it applicable to a wider set of heterogeneous domain adaptation scenarios with a large training dataset. Furthermore, our method is neither restricted to the corresponding training instances in the source and target domains nor restricted to the same type of feature, which meaningfully relaxes the requirement of training data. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingtraining setkerneldata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

This technological architecture makes use of a dataset containing electricity and gas consumption of homes distributed within multiple USA cities and states. The main purpose of our work consists in delivering to citizens a new form of self-monitoring their electricity and gas consumption, by comparing them to other homes within their cluster or state and by forecasting future energy consumptions. Moreover, the architecture also delivers to energy providers and cities a smarter overview of the energy landscape. This work uses simulated data from United States of America along with Hadoop, WEKA and Tableau to store and process Big Data, to produce clusters and time series forecasts, and to visualize information, respectively.

Those cables are heavily affected by ionization, as well as thermal and mechanical stresses. At the same time, both pinpointing and repairing faults is very costly and time consuming. This has caused many power distribution companies to search for ways of predicting cable failures based on available historical data.In this paper, we investigate five different models estimating the probability of failures for in-service underground cables. In particular, we focus on a methodology for evaluating how well different models fit the historical data. In many practical cases, the amount of data available is very limited, and it is difficult to know how much confidence should one have in the goodness-of-fit results.We use two goodness-of-fit measures, a commonly used one based on mean square error and a new one based on calculating the probability of generating the data from a given model. The corresponding results for a real data set can then be interpreted by comparing against confidence intervals obtained from synthetic data generated according to different models.Our results show that the goodness-of-fit of several commonly used failure rate models, such as linear, piecewise linear and exponential, are virtually identical. In addition, they do not explain the data as well as a new model we introduce: piecewise constant.",2015,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data miningmachine learningsimulationstatisticscomputer science

Therefore, it has become imperative to investigate and compare the effectiveness of the two types of implementations in terms of their relative performance. This will help developers and researches in making the right choice of technology for implementing the required functionalities through web services. Also, by analysing the two approaches, it can be investigated whether and how the best features of the two can be combined to provide a more useful and improved way of implementing web services.

Collective Prediction of Multiple Types of Links in Heterogeneous Information Networks,Bokai Cao (University of Illinois at Chicago)Xiangnan Kong (University of Illinois at Chicago)Philip S. Yu (University of Illinois at Chicago),"2131202988,2204127537,2125104194","Link prediction has become an important and active research topic in recent years, which is prevalent in many real-world applications. Current research on link prediction focuses on predicting one single type of links, such as friendship links in social networks, or predicting multiple types of links independently. However, many real-world networks involve more than one type of links, and different types of links are not independent, but related with complex dependencies among them. In such networks, the prediction tasks for different types of links are also correlated and the links of different types should be predicted collectively. In this paper, we study the problem of collective prediction of multiple types of links in heterogeneous information networks. To address this problem, we introduce the linkage homophily principle and design a relatedness measure, called RM, between different types of objects to compute the existence probability of a link. We also extend conventional proximity measures to heterogeneous links. Furthermore, we propose an iterative framework for heterogeneous collective link prediction, called HCLP, to predict multiple types of links collectively by exploiting diverse and complex linkage information in heterogeneous information networks. Empirical studies on real-world tasks demonstrate that the proposed collective link prediction approach can effectively boost link prediction performances in heterogeneous information networks.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: chemical industrycouplingcorrelationsemanticsdata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningmathematics

Moreover, the recent explosion of interest in wearable devices, which typically have limited computational resources, has created a growing need for very efficient classification algorithms. A commonly used technique to glean the benefits of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, without inheriting its undesirable time complexity, is to use the Nearest Centroid algorithm. However, because of the unique properties of (most) time series data, the centroid typically does not resemble any of the instances, an unintuitive and underappreciated fact. In this work we show that we can exploit a recent result to allow meaningful averaging of 'warped' times series, and that this result allows us to create ultra-efficient Nearest 'Centroid' classifiers that are at least as accurate as their more lethargic Nearest Neighbor cousins.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: dynamic time warpingprototypeaccuracy and precisionk nearest neighbors algorithmtime seriesstatistical classificationartificial neural networkdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science

Generally, different views provide complementary information for learning tasks. Thus, multi-view learning can facilitate the learning process and is prevalent in a wide range of application domains. For example, in medical science, measurements from a series of medical examinations are documented for each subject, including clinical, imaging, immunologic, serologic and cognitive measures which are obtained from multiple sources. Specifically, for brain diagnosis, we can have different quantitative analysis which can be seen as different feature subsets of a subject. It is desirable to combine all these features in an effective way for disease diagnosis. However, some measurements from less relevant medical examinations can introduce irrelevant information which can even be exaggerated after view combinations. Feature selection should therefore be incorporated in the process of multi-view learning. In this paper, we explore tensor product to bring different views together in a joint space, and present a dual method of tensor-based multi-view feature selection DUAL-TMFS based on the idea of support vector machine recursive feature elimination.

They require tensor factorization methods scalable with both the dimension and size of a tensor. In this paper, we propose two distributed tensor factorization methods, SALS and CDTF. Both methods are scalable with all aspects of data, and they show an interesting trade-off between convergence speed and memory requirements. SALS updates a subset of the columns of a factor matrix at a time, and CDTF, a special case of SALS, updates one column at a time. On our experiment, only our methods factorize a 5-dimensional tensor with 1B observable entries, 10M mode length, and 1K rank, while all other state-of-the-art methods fail.

This problem is particularly challenging in the context of networks, which contain different aspects such as the topological structure, content, and user supervision. These different aspects need to be combined effectively, in order to create a holistic similarity function. In particular, while most similarity learning methods in networks such as Sim Rank utilize the topological structure, the user supervision and content are rarely considered. In this paper, a Factorized Similarity Learning (FSL) is proposed to integrate the link, node content, and user supervision into an uniform framework. This is learned by using matrix factorization, and the final similarities are approximated by the span of low rank matrices. The proposed framework is further extended to a noise-tolerant version by adopting a hinge-loss alternatively. To facilitate efficient computation on large scale data, a parallel extension is developed. Experiments are conducted on the DBLP and CoRA datasets.

UFP-growth is one of the frequently cited algorithms for mining uncertain data. However, the corresponding UFP-tree structure can be large.

But reviews systems are often targeted by opinion spamming. Although fake review detection has been studied by researchers for years using supervised learning, ground truth of large scale datasets is still unavailable and most of existing approaches of supervised learning are based on pseudo fake reviews rather than real fake reviews. Working with Dianping, the largest Chinese review hosting site, we present the first reported work on fake review detection in Chinese with filtered reviews from Dianping's fake review detection system. Dianping's algorithm has a very high precision, but the recall is hard to know. This means that all fake reviews detected by the system are almost certainly fake but the remaining reviews (unknown set) may not be all genuine. Since the unknown set may contain many fake reviews, it is more appropriate to treat it as an unlabeled set. This calls for the model of learning from positive and unlabeled examples (PU learning). By leveraging the intricate dependencies among reviews, users and IP addresses, we first propose a collective classification algorithm called Multi-typed Heterogeneous Collective Classification (MHCC) and then extend it to Collective Positive and Unlabeled learning (CPU). Our experiments are conducted on real-life reviews of 500 restaurants in Shanghai, China.

That is, the more frequently two persons meet, the stronger their mobility relationship is. However, we argue that not all the meeting events are equally important in measuring the mobility relationship and propose to consider personal and global factors to differentiate meeting events. Personal factor models the probability for an individual user to visit a certain location, whereas the global factor models the popularity of a location based on the behavior of general public. In addition, we introduce the temporal factor to further consider the time gaps between meeting events. Accordingly, we propose a unified framework, called PGT, that considers personal, global, and temporal factors to measure the strength of the relationship between two given mobile users.

While a variety of features could be extracted from these data, these features are Interco related and redundant. Thus, selecting good features and integrating the feature selection into the fitting of a ranking model are essential. To this end, in this paper, we first strategically mine the fine-grained discrminative features from user reviews and moving behaviors, and then propose a probabilistic sparse pair wise ranking method for estates. Specifically, we first extract the explicit features from online user reviews which express users' opinions about point of interests (POIs) near an estate. We also mine the implicit features from offline moving behaviors from multiple perspectives (e.g., Direction, volume, velocity, heterogeneity, topic, popularity, etc.). Then we learn an estate ranking predictor by combining a pair wise ranking objective and a sparsity regularization in a unified probabilistic framework.

Unlike promotional campaigns on TV or other traditional mass media platforms, campaigns on social media often appear in stealth modes. Campaign promoters often try to influence people's behaviors/opinions/decisions in a latent manner such that the readers are not aware that the messages they see are strategic campaign posts aimed at persuading them to buy target products/services. Readers take such campaign posts as just organic posts from the general public. It is thus important to discover such campaigns, their promoter accounts and how the campaigns are organized and executed as it can uncover the dynamics of Internet marketing. This discovery is clearly useful for competitors and also the general public. However, so far little work has been done to solve this problem.

Practical importance of this problem is attested by a large number of companies that continuously collect and update statistics about popular entities, usually using the degree of an entity as an approximation of its popularity. We suggest a simple, efficient, and easy to implement two-stage randomized algorithm that provides highly accurate solutions to this problem.

Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods and serves many different purposes such as finding the most popular users or the most popular interest groups in social networks. An important contribution of this work is the analysis of the proposed algorithm using Extreme Value Theory -- a branch of probability that studies extreme events and properties of largest order statistics in random samples. Using this theory we derive an accurate prediction for the algorithm's performance and show that the number of API requests for finding the top-k most popular entities is sub linear in the number of entities.

RHD is important for the applications such as crime analysis, where it may focus the search for crime source's location, e.g. The home of a serial criminal. RHD is challenging because of the large number of candidate rings and the high computational cost of the statistical significance test. Previous statistically significant hotspot detection techniques (e.g., Sat Scan) identify circular/rectangular areas, but can not discover rings. This paper proposes a dual grid based pruning (DGP) approach to detect ring-shaped hotspots. A case study on real crime data confirms that DGP detects novel ring-shaped regions, regions that go undetected by Sat Scan. Experiments show that DGP improves the computational cost of a naive approach substantially.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: upper and lower boundsmathematical modelmonte carlo methodbioinformaticsdata miningmachine learningstatisticsalgorithmcomputer sciencemathematics

In this paper, we propose a novel one-class semi-supervised algorithm to detect anomalies in streaming data.

The piecewise constant density estimate of each RS-tree is defined on the tree node into which an instance falls. Each incoming instance in a data stream is scored by the density estimates averaged over all trees in the forest. Two strategies, statistical attribute range estimation of high probability guarantee and dual node profiles for rapid model update, are seamlessly integrated into RS Forestto systematically address the ever-evolving nature of data streams. We derive the theoretical upper bound for the proposed algorithm and analyze its asymptotic properties via bias-variance decomposition.

Machine learning techniques for now casting the flu have made significant inroads into correlating social media trends to case counts and prevalence of epidemics in a population. There is a disconnect between data-driven methods for forecasting flu incidence and epidemiological models that adopt a state based understanding of transitions, that can lead to sub-optimal predictions. Furthermore, models for epidemiological activity and social activity like on Twitter predict different shapes and have important differences. We propose a temporal topic model to capture hidden states of a user from his tweets and aggregate states in a geographical region for better estimation of trends. We show that our approach helps fill the gap between phenomenological methods for disease surveillance and epidemiological models.

They collude with each other to imitate normal users by quickly accumulating a large number of ""human"" friends. In addition, content information in social media is noisy and unstructured.

Road Traffic Congestion Monitoring in Social Media with Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields,Po-Ta ChenFeng ChenZhen Qian,"2654048806,2662008939,2655769949","Real-time road traffic congestion monitoring is an important and challenging problem. Most existing monitoring approaches require the deployment of infrastructure sensors or large-scale probe vehicles. Their installation is often expensive and temporal-spatial coverage is limited. Probe vehicle data are oftentimes noisy on urban arterials, and therefore insufficient to provide accurate congestion estimation. This paper presents a novel social-media based approach to traffic congestion monitoring, in which pedestrians, drivers, and passengers a retreated as human sensors and their posted tweets in Twitter as observations of nearby ongoing traffic conditions. There are three technical challenges for road traffic monitoring based on Twitter, namely: 1) language ambiguity in the usage of traffic related terms, 2) uncertainty and low resolution of geographic location mentions, and 3) interactions between traffic-related events such as accidents and congestion. We propose a topic modeling based language model to address the first challenge and a collaborative inference model based on probabilistic soft logic (PSL) to address the second and third challenges. We present a unified statistical framework that combines those two models based on hinge loss Markov random fields (HLMRFs). In order to address the computational challenges incurred by the non-analytical integral of latent variables (factors) and the MAP estimation of a large number of location-dependent traffic congestion variables, we propose a fast approximate inference algorithm based on maximization expectation (ME) and the alternating directed method of multipliers (ADMM).

Low-Rank Common Subspace for Multi-view Learning,Zhengming Ding (Northeastern University)Yun Fu (Northeastern University),"2235073056,2123131494","Multi-view data is very popular in real-world applications, as different view-points and various types of sensors help to better represent data when fused across views or modalities. Samples from different views of the same class are less similar than those with the same view but different class. We consider a more general case that prior view information of testing data is inaccessible in multi-view learning. Traditional multi-view learning algorithms were designed to obtain multiple view-specific linear projections and would fail without this prior information available. That was because they assumed the probe and gallery views were known in advance, so the correct view-specific projections were to be applied in order to better learn low-dimensional features. To address this, we propose a Low-Rank Common Subspace (LRCS) for multi-view data analysis, which seeks a common low-rank linear projection to mitigate the semantic gap among different views. The low-rank common projection is able to capture compatible intrinsic information across different views and also well-align the within-class samples from different views. Furthermore, with a low-rank constraint on the view-specific projected data and that transformed by the common subspace, the within-class samples from multiple views would concentrate together. Different from the traditional supervised multi-view algorithms, our LRCS works in a weakly supervised way, where only the view information gets observed. Such a common projection can make our model more flexible when dealing with the problem of lacking prior view information of testing data. Two scenarios of experiments, robust subspace learning and transfer learning, are conducted to evaluate our algorithm. Experimental results on several multi-view datasets reveal that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art, even when compared with some supervised learning methods.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: facerobustnessalgorithm designnoisesoftware testinglinear programmingdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics
Robust Spectral Learning for Unsupervised Feature Selection,Lei Shi (Chinese Academy of Sciences)Liang Du (Chinese Academy of Sciences)Yi-Dong Shen (Chinese Academy of Sciences),"2706038507,1909139773,2129952813","In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised feature selection. Recently, spectral feature selection algorithms, which leverage both graph Laplacian and spectral regression, have received increasing attention. However, existing spectral feature selection algorithms suffer from two major problems: 1) since the graph Laplacian is constructed from the original feature space, noisy and irrelevant features may have adverse effect on the estimated graph Laplacian and hence degenerate the quality of the induced graph embedding, 2) since the cluster labels are discrete in natural, relaxing and approximating these labels into a continuous embedding can inevitably introduce noise into the estimated cluster labels. Without considering the noise in the cluster labels, the feature selection process may be misguided. In this paper, we propose a Robust Spectral learning framework for unsupervised Feature Selection (RSFS), which jointly improves the robustness of graph embedding and sparse spectral regression. Compared with existing methods which are sensitive to noisy features, our proposed method utilizes a robust local learning method to construct the graph Laplacian and a robust spectral regression method to handle the noise on the learned cluster labels. In order to solve the proposed optimization problem, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed. We also show the close connection between the proposed robust spectral regression and robust Huber M-estimator.

Yu (University of Illinois at Chicago),"2096615129,2105415358,2153251044,2125104194","As viral marketing in online social networks flourishes recently, a lot of attention has been drawn to the study of influence maximization in social networks. However, most works in influence maximization have overlooked the important role that social network providers (websites) play in the diffusion processes. Viral marketing campaigns are usually sold by websites as services to their clients. The websites can not only select initial sets of users to start diffusion processes, but can also have impacts throughout the diffusion processes by deciding when the information should be brought to the attention of individual users. This is especially true when user attention is limited, and the websites have to notify users about an item to bring it into the attention of users. In this paper, we study the diffusion of information from the perspective of social network websites. We propose a novel push-driven cascade (PDC) model, which emphasizes the role of websites during the diffusion of information. In the PDC model, the website ""pushes"" items to bring them to the attention of users, and whether a user is interested in an item is decided by her preference and the social influence from her friends. Analogous to the influence maximization problem on the traditional information diffusion models, we propose a dynamic influence maximization problem on the PDC model, which is defined as a sequential decision making problem for the website. We show that the problem can be formalized as a Markov sequential decision problem, and there exists a deterministic Markovian policy that is an optimal solution for the problem. We develop an AO algorithm that finds the optimal solution for the problem, and a heuristic online search algorithm, which has similar effectiveness, but is significantly more efficient.

In reality, however, majority of these trajectories are collected at a low sampling rate and only provide partial observations on their actually traversed routes. Consequently, they are mired with uncertainty. In this paper, we develop a technique called Infer Tra to infer uncertain trajectories from network-constrained partial observations. Rather than predicting the most likely route, the inferred uncertain trajectory takes the form of an edge-weighted graph and summarizes all probable routes in a holistic manner. For trajectory inference, Infer Tra employs Gibbs sampling by learning a Network Mobility Model (NMM) from a database of historical trajectories. Extensive experiments on real trajectory databases show that the graph-based approach of Infer Tra is up to 50% more accurate, 20 times faster, and immensely more versatile than state-of-the-art techniques.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: trajectoryuncertaintyrandom variabledata miningmachine learningsimulationstatisticsmathematics
Online Spectral Learning on a Graph with Bandit Feedback,Quanquan Gu (Princeton University)Jiawei Han (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign),"2167348148,2121939561","Online learning on a graph is appealing due to its efficiency. However, existing online learning algorithms on a graph are limited to binary classification. Moreover, they require accessing the full label information, where the label oracle needs to return the true class label after the learner makes classification of each node. In many application scenarios, we only have access to partial label information, where the label oracle will return a single bit indicating whether the prediction is correct or not, instead of the true class label. This is also known as bandit feedback. In this paper, to overcome the above limitations of existing online learning algorithms on a graph, we study online learning on a graph for multi-class node classification, in both the full information setting and the partial information setting. First, we present an online multi-class classification algorithm in the full information setting. It is based on function learning on a graph using the spectral information of the graph Laplacian. We show that it attains O (cd log T) regret bound, where T is the number of rounds in online learning, c is the number of classes, and d is the number of eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian used for learning. Second, we present an online multi-class classification algorithm with bandit feedback. We use upper-confidence bound technique to trade off the exploration and exploitation of label information. We show that it attains O (cd a#x221A;T log T) regret bound, which is only a a#x221A;T factor worse than the proposed algorithm in the full information setting. Experiments on several benchmark graph datasets show that the proposed online multi-class classification algorithm beats the state-of-art baseline, and the proposed bandit algorithm is also much better than the bandit version of the baseline.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: predictionalgorithm designdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

We are particularly interested in a volatility shift which is a change in the rate of change (e.g. From high volatility to low volatility). We introduce and define the concept of stream volatility, and propose a novel technique to detect volatility on data streams in the presence of concept drifts. In the experiments we show our algorithm to be both fast and efficient.

However, the shortness and informality of tweets leads to extreme sparse vector representation with a large vocabulary, which makes the conventional topic models (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) often fail to achieve high quality underlying topics. Luckily, tweets always show up with rich user-generated hash tags as keywords. In this paper, we propose a novel topic model to handle such semi-structured tweets, denoted as Hash tag Graph based Topic Model (HGTM). By utilizing relation information between hash tags in our hash tag graph, HGTMestablishes word semantic relations, even if they haven't co-occurred within a specific tweet. In addition, we enhance the dependencies of both multiple words and hash tags via latent variables (topics) modeled by HGTM. We illustrate that the user-contributed hash tags could serve as weakly-supervised information for topic modeling, and hash tag relation could reveal the semantic relation between tweets.

One way of humanizing such interaction is to provide a framework that can recognize the emotions present in the communication or the emotions of the involved users in order to enrich user experience. For example, by providing insights to users for personal preferences and automated recommendations based on their emotional state. In this work, we propose a framework for emotion classification in English sentences where emotions are treated as generalized concepts extracted from the sentences. We start by generating an intermediate emotional data representation of a given input sentence based on its syntactic and semantic structure. We then generalize this representation using various ontologies such as Word Net and Concept Net, which results in an emotion seed that we call an emotion recognition rule (ERR). Finally, we use a suite of classifiers to compare the generated ERR with a set of reference ERRs extracted from a training set in a similar fashion. The used classifiers are k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with handcrafted similarity measure, Point Mutual Information (PMI), and PMI with Information Retrieval (PMI-IR).

Our aim is to monitor data streams statistically, and find sub sequences that have the characteristics of a given hidden Markov model (HMM). For example, consider an online web-click stream, where massive amounts of access logs of millions of users are continuously generated every second. So how can we find meaningful building blocks and typical access patterns such as weekday/weekend patterns, and also, detect anomalies and intrusions? In this paper, we propose Stream Scan, a fast and exact algorithm for monitoring multiple co-evolving data streams.

Why Checkins: Exploring User Motivation on Location Based Social Networks,Fengjiao Wang (University of Illinois at Chicago)Guan Wang (University of Illinois at Chicago)Philip S.

Therefore, knowledge discovery on check in data has become an important research direction [1], [2], [3], [4]. However, a fundamental and interesting question about checkins remains unanswered yet. What are people's motivations behind those checkins? We give the first attempt to answer this question. Motivation studies first appear in social psychology in a less quantitative way. For example, the goal-directed behavior (MGB) model [5] uncovers the association between behaviors and motivations. Following a similar rationale, we design a computational model for the mining of user check in motivations from large scale real world data. We assume that the check in motivation has two types: social motivation and individual motivation. Social motivation is the type of check in incentive that stimulates interactions or influences among friends. Individual motivation is another type of check in incentive that aims to explore and share attractive places. Following the structure of the MGB model, we construct user check in motivation prediction model (UCMP) and then formalize the motivation prediction problem as an optimization problem. The idea is minimizing the difference between the estimated behavior and the true behavior to get the predicted motivations. The experiment on this GOWALLA dataset shows not only prediction results, but also very interesting phenomenons about social users and social locations.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: attitude controlpredictive modellingpredictioncomputational modelknowledge managementdata miningmachine learningsimulationstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics
Locally Estimating Core Numbers,Michael P. OBrien (North Carolina State University)Blair D. Sullivan (North Carolina State University),"2510350849,2097060976","Graphs are a powerful way to model interactions and relationships in data from a wide variety of application domains. In this setting, entities represented by vertices at the 'center' of the graph are often more important than those associated with vertices on the 'fringes'. For example, central nodes tend to be more critical in the spread of information or disease and play an important role in clustering/community formation. Identifying such 'core' vertices has recently received additional attention in the context of network experiments, which analyze the response when a random subset of vertices are exposed to a treatment (e.g. Inoculation, free product samples, etc). Specifically, the likelihood of having many central vertices in any exposure subset can have a significant impact on the experiment. We focus on using k-cores and core numbers to measure the extent to which a vertex is central in a graph. Existing algorithms for computing the core number of a vertex require the entire graph as input, an unrealistic scenario in many real world applications. Moreover, in the context of network experiments, the sub graph induced by the treated vertices is only known in a probabilistic sense. We introduce a new method for estimating the core number based only on the properties of the graph within a region of radius a#x03B4; around the vertex, and prove an asymptotic error bound of our estimator on random graphs. Further, we empirically validate the accuracy of our estimator for small values of a#x03B4; on a representative corpus of real data sets. Finally, we evaluate the impact of improved local estimation on an open problem in network experimentation posed by Ugander et al.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: neighbourhoodstrength of a graphcomplement graphgraph bandwidthgraph centerpath graphgraph powerhypercube graphwheel graphlevel structurenull graphrandom regular graphgraph labelinggraph homomorphismcycle graphvertexloopdegreeindependent setdata modelingaccuracy and precisioncomputational complexity theoryupper and lower boundsestimationtheoretical computer sciencediscrete mathematicscombinatoricsmachine learningstatisticsmathematics
Check-in Location Prediction Using Wavelets and Conditional Random Fields,Roland Assam (RWTH Aachen University)Thomas Seidl (RWTH Aachen University),"71697769,2140301036","The widespread adoption of ubiquitous devices does not only facilitate the connection of billions of people, but has also fuelled a culture of sharing rich, high resolution locations through check-ins. Despite the profusion of GPS and WiFi driven location prediction techniques, the sparse and random nature of check-in data generation have ushered diverse problems, which have prompted the prediction of future check-ins to be very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel enhanced location predictor for check-in data that is crafted using Poisson distribution, Wavelets and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Specifically, we show that check-in generation is governed by the Poisson distribution. In addition, among others, we utilize wavelets to rigorously analyze social influence and learn elusive underlying patterns, as well as human mobility behaviors embedded in check-in data. We utilize this knowledge to institute CRF features, which capture latent trends that govern users' mobility. These CRF features are employed to build a robust predictive model that predicts future locations with enhanced accuracy.

SNOC: Streaming Network Node Classification,"Ting Guo (University of Technology, Sydney)Xingquan Zhu (Florida Atlantic University)Jian Pei (Simon Fraser University)Chengqi Zhang (University of Technology, Sydney)","2627698251,2618356905,2126330539,2166080598","Many real-world networks are featured with dynamic changes, such as new nodes and edges, and modification of the node content. Because changes are continuously introduced to the network in a streaming fashion, we refer to such dynamic networks as streaming networks. In this paper, we propose a new classification method for streaming networks, namely streaming network node classification (SNOC). For streaming networks, the essential challenge is to properly capture the dynamic changes of the node content and node interactions to support node classification. While streaming networks are dynamically evolving, for a short temporal period, a subset of salient features are essentially tied to the network content and structures, and therefore can be used to characterize the network for classification. To achieve this goal, we propose to carry out streaming network feature selection (SNF) from the network, and use selected features as gauge to classify unlabeled nodes. A Laplacian based quality criterion is proposed to guide the node classification, where the Laplacian matrix is generated based on node labels and structures. Node classification is achieved by finding the class that results in the minimal gauging value with respect to the selected features. By frequently updating the features selected from the network, node classification can quickly adapt to the changes in the network for maximal performance gain. Experiments demonstrate that SNOC is able to capture changes in network structures and node content, and outperforms baseline approaches with significant performance gain.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: accuracy and precisionbiological classificationfeature selectionlinear programmingdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics
Multi-touch Attribution in Online Advertising with Survival Theory,Ya Zhang (Shanghai Jiao Tong University)Yi Wei (Shanghai Jiao Tong University)Jianbiao Ren (Shanghai Jiao Tong University),"2627125993,2711152522,2228464424","Multi-touch attribution, which allows distributing the credit to all related advertisements based on their corresponding contributions, has recently become an important research topic in digital advertising. Traditionally, rule-based attribution models have been used in practice. The drawback of such rule-based models lies in the fact that the rules are not derived form the data but only based on simple intuition. With the ever enhanced capability to tracking advertisement and users' interaction with the advertisement, data-driven multi-touch attribution models, which attempt to infer the contribution from user interaction data, become an important research direction. We here propose a new data-driven attribution model based on survival theory. By adopting a probabilistic framework, one key advantage of the proposed model is that it is able to remove the presentation biases inherit to most of the other attribution models. In addition to model the attribution, the proposed model is also able to predict user's 'conversion' probability. We validate the proposed method with a real-world data set obtained from a operational commercial advertising monitoring company.

This is naturally interpreted as a Kalman filter with multiple interacting state space vectors. We also present a method for learning a dynamically evolving drift parameter for each location by modeling it as a geometric Brownian motion. We handle posterior intractability via a mean-field variational approximation, which also preserves tractability for downstream calculations in a manner similar to the Kalman filter.

Often, a real-world diffusion cannot be directly observed while it is occurring -- perhaps it is not noticed until some time has passed, continuous monitoring is too costly, or privacy concerns limit data access. This leads to the need to reconstruct how the present state of the diffusion came to be from partial diffusion data. Here, we tackle the problem of reconstructing a diffusion history from one or more snapshots of the diffusion state. This ability can be invaluable to learn when certain computer nodes are infected or which people are the initial disease spreaders to control future diffusions.

The Kronecker family of models are appealing because of their elegant fractal structure, as well as their ability to capture important network characteristics such as degree, diameter, and (in the case of mKPGM) clustering and population variance. In addition, scalable sampling algorithms for KPGMs made the analysis of large-scale, sparse networks feasible for the first time.

These anomalies are difficult to detect because the distributed systems may not have sufficient sensors to monitor the flow of traffic within the interconnected nodes of the networks.

Specifically, we demonstrate the application of low density separation principle to devise a splitting criterion for rapidly generating a high-quality tree, thus maximizing the benefits of SVMs training.

Naive-Bayes Inspired Effective Pre-Conditioner for Speeding-Up Logistic Regression,Nayyar A. Zaidi (Monash University)Mark James Carman (Monash University)Jesús Cerquides (Spanish National Research Council)Geoffrey I. Webb (Monash University),"2131465174,2123487663,1977227655,2126304162","We propose an alternative parameterization of Logistic Regression (LR) for the categorical data, multi-class setting. LR optimizes the conditional log-likelihood over the training data and is based on an iterative optimization procedure to tune this objective function. The optimization procedure employed may be sensitive to scale and hence an effective pre-conditioning method is recommended. Many problems in machine learning involve arbitrary scales or categorical data (where simple standardization of features is not applicable). The problem can be alleviated by using optimization routines that are invariant to scale such as (second-order) Newton methods. However, computing and inverting the Hessian is a costly procedure and not feasible for big data. Thus one must often rely on first-order methods such as gradient descent (GD), stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or approximate second-order such as quasi-Newton (QN) routines, which are not invariant to scale. This paper proposes a simple yet effective pre-conditioner for speeding-up LR based on naive Bayes conditional probability estimates. The idea is to scale each attribute by the log of the conditional probability of that attribute given the class. This formulation substantially speeds-up LR's convergence. It also provides a weighted naive Bayes formulation which yields an effective framework for hybrid generative-discriminative classification.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: stochastic gradient descentniobiumlogisticslogistic regressionconvergencebiological classificationmathematical modeldata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

It is difficult or impossible to directly measure such correlations among different organizations, because important information is usually not publicly available (e.g., The correlations of terrorist organizations). Nowadays, an increasing amount of organizational information can be posted online by individuals and spread instantly through Twitter. Such information can be crucial for detecting organizational correlations. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering correlations among organizations from Twitter. Mining organizational correlations is a very challenging task due to the following reasons: a) Data in Twitter occurs as large volumes of mixed information. The most relevant information about organizations is often buried. Thus, the organizational correlations can be scattered in multiple places, represented by different forms, b) Making use of information from Twitter collectively and judiciously is difficult because of the multiple representations of organizational correlations that are extracted. In order to address these issues, we propose Multi-CG (Multiple Correlation Graphs based model), an unsupervised framework that can learn a consensus of correlations among organizations based on multiple representations extracted from Twitter, which is more accurate and robust than correlations based on a single representation. Empirical study shows that the consensus graph extracted from Twitter can capture the organizational correlations effectively.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: organizationcorrelationdata scienceworld wide webdata miningcomputer sciencemathematics

In this paper, we propose a scheme to dramatically improve the scalability and efficiency of SVM cross-validation through the following key ideas. (i) To avoid holding the whole dataset in the memory and avoid performing repeated kernel value computation, we precompute the kernel values and reuse them. (ii) We store the precomputed kernel values to a high-speed storage framework, consisting of CPU memory extended by solid state drives (SSDs) and GPU memory as a cache, so that reusing (i.e., Reading) kernel values takes much lesser time than computing them on-the-fly. (iii) To further improve the efficiency of the SVM training, we apply a number of techniques for the extreme example search algorithm, design a parallel kernel value read algorithm, propose a caching strategy well-suited to the characteristics of the storage framework, and parallelize the tasks on the GPU and the CPU.

The adversary pays a cost proportional to the size of ""attack"". We refer to this form of adversarial behavior as a dense feature attack.

Cyberbullying Detection using Time Series Modeling,Nektaria Potha (University of the Aegean)Manolis Maragoudakis (University of the Aegean),"2312234157,2137015354","Cyber bullying is a new phenomenon resulting from the advance of new communication technologies including the Internet, cell phones and Personal Digital Assistants. It is a challenging bullying problem occurring in a new territory. Online bullying can be particularly damaging and upsetting because it's usually anonymous or hard to trace. In this paper, the proposed method is utilizing a dataset of real world conversations (i.e. Pairs of questions and answers between cyber predator and the victim), in which each predator question is manually annotated in terms of severity using a numeric label. We approach the issue as a sequential data modelling approach, in which the predator's questions are formulated using a Singular Value Decomposition representation. The motivation of this procedure is to study the accuracy of predicting the level of cyber bullying attack using classification methods and also to examine potential patterns between the lingustic style of each predator. More specifically, unlike previous approaches that consider a fixed window of a cyber-predator's questions within a dialogue, we exploit the whole question set and model it as a signal, whose magnitude depends on the degree of bullying content. Using feature weighting and dimensionality reduction techniques, each signal is straightforwardly parsed by a neural network that forecasts the level of insult within a question given a window between two and three previous questions. Throughout the time series modeling experiments, an interesting discovery was made. By applying SVD on the time series data and taking into account the second dimension (since the first is usually modeling trivial dependencies between instances and attributes) we observed that its plot was very similar to the plot of the class attribute.

In the context of urban transportation networks of growing complexity, the management of non-recurrent road traffic events, estimated to account for close to 50% of the total travel-time delay on road networks, requires advanced predictive methods, supporting both response plan deployment and traveller information. In this work, we consider the problem of predicting how a non-recurrent traffic event, such as a road incident, impacts traffic conditions at the incident location in the future. Based on a detailed statistical analysis of a large dataset of traffic incidents, we propose a parametric piecewise-affine incident model. The model is calibrated offline using a combination of constrained and unconstrained non-linear regression methods, and is shown to provide a good fit. The prediction of local incident impact is achieved via the design of a neural network model learning the parametric fit of the incident model based on available incident features. The neural network-based prediction model is shown to outperform state-of-the-art prediction methods such as multivariate decision trees.

In this paper we introduce an effectively- and efficiently-superior algorithm for reducing the dimensionality of logical data (categorical data in general) in the context of a new data mining challenge: Ternary Matrix Factorization (TMF). For a ternary data matrix, TMF exploits ternary logic to produce a basis matrix (which holds the major patterns in the data) and a usage matrix (which maps patterns to original observations). Both matrices are interpretable, and their ternary matrix product approximates the original matrix. TMF has applications in 1) finding targeted structure in ternary data, 2) imputing values through pattern-discovery in highly-incomplete categorical data sets, and 3) solving instances of its encapsulated Binary Matrix Factorization (BMF) problem. Our elegant algorithm Faster (Fast Ternary Matrix Factorization) has linear run-time complexity with respect to the dimensions of the data set and is parameter-robust. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that we are able to efficiently and effectively outperform state-of-the-art techniques in all three TMF applications.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: logical matrixmatrix decompositiondiscrete mathematicsdata miningmachine learningstatisticsmathematics
Composite Likelihood Data Augmentation for Within-Network Statistical Relational Learning,Joseph J. Pfeiffer (Purdue University)Jennifer Neville (Purdue University)Paul N. Bennett (Microsoft),"2135459169,2124572662,2137013502","The prevalence of datasets that can be represented as networks has recently fueled a great deal of work in the area of Relational Machine Learning (RML). Due to the statistical correlations between linked nodes in the network, many RML methods focus on predicting node features (i.e., labels) using the network relationships. However, many domains are comprised of a single, partially-labeled network. Thus, relational versions of Expectation Maximization (i.e., R-EM), which jointly learn parameters and infer the missing labels, can outperform methods that learn parameters from the labeled data and apply them for inference on the unlabeled nodes. Although R-EM methods can significantly improve predictive performance in networks that are densely labeled, they do not achieve the same gains in sparsely labeled networks and can perform worse than RML methods. In this work, we show the fixed-point methods that R-EM uses for approximate learning and inference result in errors that prevent convergence in sparsely labeled networks. We then propose two methods that do not experience this problem. First, we develop a Relational Stochastic EM (R-SEM) method, which uses stochastic parameters that are not as susceptible to approximation errors. Then we develop a Relational Data Augmentation (R-DA) method, which integrates over a range of stochastic parameter values for inference. R-SEM and R-DA can use any collective RML algorithm for learning and inference in partially labeled networks. We analyze their performance with two RML learners over four real world datasets, and show that they outperform independent learning, RML and R-EM -- particularly in sparsely labeled networks.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: markov processestimationstatistical relational learningdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics
Refining Adverse Drug Reactions Using Association Rule Mining for Electronic Healthcare Data,"Jenna Marie Reps (University of Nottingham)Uwe Aickelin (University of Nottingham)Jiangang Ma (Victoria University, Australia)Yanchun Zhang (Victoria University, Australia)","2044421523,269644229,2128019168,2100438523","Side effects of prescribed medications are a common occurrence. Electronic healthcare databases present the opportunity to identify new side effects efficiently but currently the methods are limited due to confounding (i.e. When an association between two variables is identified due to them both being associated to a third variable). In this paper we propose a proof of concept method that learns common associations and uses this knowledge to automatically refine side effect signals (i.e. Exposure-outcome associations) by removing instances of the exposure-outcome associations that are caused by confounding. This leaves the signal instances that are most likely to correspond to true side effect occurrences. We then calculate a novel measure termed the confounding-adjusted risk value, a more accurate absolute risk value of a patient experiencing the outcome within 60 days of the exposure. Tentative results suggest that the method works. For the four signals (i.e. Exposure-outcome associations) investigated we are able to correctly filter the majority of exposure-outcome instances that were unlikely to correspond to true side effects. The method is likely to improve when tuning the association rule mining parameters for specific health outcomes. This paper shows that it may be possible to filter signals at a patient level based on association rules learned from considering patients' medical histories. However, additional work is required to develop a way to automate the tuning of the method's parameters.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: alternative dispute resolutionassociation rule learninglogisticsdata sciencedata miningcomputer science

Compared with traditional user feedbacks such as comments and ratings, these specific emotion annotations are more accurate for expressing users' personal emotions. In this paper, we propose to exploit these users' emotion annotations for online news in order to track the evolution of emotions, which plays an important role in various online services. A critical challenge is how to model emotions with respect to time spans. To this end, we propose a time-aware topic modeling perspective for solving this problem. Specifically, we first develop a model named emotion-Topic over Time (eToT), in which we represent the topics of news as a Beta distribution over time and a multinomial distribution over emotions. Whilee ToT can uncover the latent relationship among news, emotion and time directly, it cannot capture the dynamics of topics. Therefore, we further develop another model named emotion based Dynamic Topic Model (eDTM), where we explore the state space model for tracking the dynamics of topics. In addition, we demonstrate that both eToT and eDTM could enable several potential applications, such as emotion prediction, emotion-based news recommendations and emotion anomaly detections.

However, what is not reported is that great time and effort are required to construct a graph Laplacian to achieve these successes. This problem which we call Laplacian construction is critical for the success of spectral clustering but is not well studied by the community. Instead the best Laplacian is typically learnt for each domain from trial and error. This is problematic for areas such as medical imaging since: i) the same images can be segmented in multiple ways depending on the application focus and ii) we don't wish to construct one Laplacian, rather we wish to create a method to construct a Laplacian for each patient's scan. In this paper we attempt to automate the process of Laplacian creation with the help of guidance towards the application focus. In most domains creating a basic Laplacian is plausible, so we propose adjusting this given Laplacian by discovering important nodes. We formulate this problem as an integer linear program with a precise geometric interpretation which is globally minimized using large scale solvers such as Gurobi.

We describe the label-power set-based solutions under a general framework of meta-labels and provide some theoretical justification for this framework which has been lacking, explaining how meta-labels essentially allow a random projection into a space where non-linearities can easily be tackled with established linear learning algorithms.

They have been widely used to represent various network systems, such as social networks, biological networks and etc. Knowledge discovery on linked data is of great importance to many real applications. One of the major challenges of learning linked data is how to effectively and efficiently extract useful information from both node attributes and links in linked data. Current studies on this topic either use selected topological statistics to represent network structures, or linearly map node attributes and network structures to a shared latent feature space. However, while approaches based on statistics may miss critical patterns in network structure, approaches based on linear mappings may not be sufficient to capture the non-linear characteristics of nodes and links. To handle the challenge, we propose, to our knowledge, the first deep learning method to learn from linked data. A restricted Boltzmann machine model named LRBM is developed for representation learning on linked data. In LRBM, we aim to extract the latent feature representation of each node from both node attributes and network structures, non-linearly map each pair of nodes to the links, and use hidden units to control the mapping. The details of how to adapt LRBM for link prediction and node classification on linked data have also been presented. In the experiments, we test the performance of LRBM as well as other baselines on link prediction and node classification.

By concentrating the efforts on a few key customers, targeted marketing could make the promotion of the items (products) much easier and more cost-effective. On the other hand, viral marketing aims at finding a set of individuals (seeds) to maximize the word-of-mouth propagation of an item. However, these two marketing strategies can only exploit some specific characteristics of the social networks, and the problem of how to combine them together to build a better, stronger business is still open. To that end, in this paper, we propose a general approach for integrated marketing. Specifically, to market a given item, we first generate the item-specific candidate users by a recommendation algorithm, and then select the typical users who have the best balanced utility scores and consumption/social entropy. Next, treating typical users as targeted customers, we study the problem of maximizing information awareness in viral marketing with these constrained targets. Along this line, we define it as a constrained coverage maximization problem, and propose three solutions: GMIC, LMIC and QMIC. Finally, extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our integrated marketing approach could outperform the methods that consider only targeted marketing or viral marketing.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: compensation methodsviral marketingmarketing strategycollaborationcultural diversitygreedy algorithmentropycomputational modelpublic sector marketingbusiness marketingpersonalized marketingmarketing researchdigital marketinglinear programmingmarketingdata miningcomputer science

Such recommendation should happen in real-time as new contents become available, because ""freshness"" is an important consideration in people's content-consumption behavior. Representing users and contents as feature vectors in a high-dimensional space, we can essentially cast the problem of real-time recommendations as the problem of computing the list of k nearest neighbors of each user, which we call kNN join. Given the vast volume of contents and users, the biggest challenge is how to continuously update the kNN join results as new contents arrive. Existing methods for incremental kNN join on data streams suffer from the ""curse of dimensionality"" and high in-memory search cost. In this paper, we present a solution that first identifies the users whose kNN's might be affected by the newly arrived content, and then update their kNN's respectively. We propose a new index structure named HDR-tree in order to support the efficient search of affected users. HDR-tree performs dimensionality reduction through clustering and principle component analysis (PCA) in order to improve the search effectiveness. To further reduce response time, we propose a variant of HDR-tree, called HDR-tree, that supports more efficient but approximate solutions.

To deal with buzz time-series sequences, we propose a novel time-series modeling approach which captures the rise and fade temporal patterns via Product Life Cycle (PLC) models, a classical concept in economics.

Triggered by this question, we investigate under which conditions it is possible to compute a graph kernel explicitly and for which graph properties this computation is actually more efficient. We give a sufficient condition for R-convolution kernels that enables kernel computation by explicit mapping. We theoretically and experimentally analyze efficiency and flexibility of implicit kernel functions and dot products of explicitly computed feature maps for widely used graph kernels such as random walk kernels, sub graph matching kernels, and shortest-path kernels.

Probabilistic Latent Document Network Embedding,Tuan M. V.

In this paper, we study the problem of embedding, or finding a low-dimensional representation of a document network that ""preserves"" the data as much as possible. These embedded representations are useful for various applications driven by dimensionality reduction, such as visualization or feature selection. While previous works in embedding have mostly focused on either the textual aspect or the network aspect, we advocate a holistic approach by finding a unified low-rank representation for both aspects. Moreover, to lend semantic interpretability to the low-rank representation, we further propose to integrate topic modeling and embedding within a joint model.

Privacy-Preserving Personalized Recommendation: An Instance-Based Approach via Differential Privacy,Yilin Shen (Samsung)Hongxia Jin (Samsung),"2661020293,2695107538","Recommender systems become increasingly popular and widely applied nowadays. The release of users' private data is required to provide users accurate recommendations, yet this has been shown to put users at risk. Unfortunately, existing privacy-preserving methods are either developed under trusted server settings with impractical private recommender systems or lack of strong privacy guarantees. In this paper, we develop the first lightweight and provably private solution for personalized recommendation, under untrusted server settings. In this novel setting, users' private data is obfuscated before leaving their private devices, giving users greater control on their data and service providers less responsibility on privacy protections. More importantly, our approach enables the existing recommender systems (with no changes needed) to directly use perturbed data, rendering our solution very desirable in practice. We develop our data perturbation approach on differential privacy, the state-of-the-art privacy model with lightweight computation and strong but provable privacy guarantees. In order to achieve useful and feasible perturbations, we first design a novel relaxed admissible mechanism enabling the injection of flexible instance-based noises. Using this novel mechanism, our data perturbation approach, incorporating the noise calibration and learning techniques, obtains perturbed user data with both theoretical privacy and utility guarantees. Our empirical evaluation on large-scale real-world datasets not only shows its high recommendation accuracy but also illustrates the negligible computational overhead on both personal computers and smart phones. As such, we are able to meet two contradictory goals, privacy preservation and recommendation accuracy. This practical technology helps to gain user adoption with strong privacy protection and benefit companies with high-quality personalized services on perturbed user data.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: privacy softwaredifferential privacyprobabilistic analysis of algorithmsserversensitivityprivacynoiserecommender systeminternet privacyworld wide webdata miningcomputer science

It allows a structural SVM to handle distance space data and function as the nearest neighbor classifier, the combination of which is known to be highly competitive in time series classification. We then extend the zero-norm approximation method for the structural SVM, which can eliminate non-essential patterns from the classification model.

Those techniques originally analyze on words in the documents, but their extensions currently accommodate meta-data such as authorship information, which has been proved useful for textual modeling. The importance of learning authorship is to extract author interests and assign authors to anonymous texts. Author-Topic (AT) model, an unsupervised learning technique, successfully exploits authorship information to model both documents and author interests using topic representations. However, the AT model simplifies that each author has equal contribution on multiple-author documents. To overcome this limitation, we assumes that authors give different degrees of contributions on a document by using a Dirichlet distribution. This automatically transforms the unsupervised AT model to Supervised Author-Topic (SAT) model, which brings a novelty of authorship prediction on anonymous texts. The SAT model outperforms the AT model for identifying authors of documents written by either single authors or multiple authors with a better Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and a significantly higher Area Under Curve (AUC).

The core issue is that the hidden generative function of the data is not a constant function, but rather evolves over time. This is known as a non-stationary distribution. In this paper, we describe a new approach to using ensembles for stream classification. While the core method is straightforward, it is specifically designed to adapt quickly with very little overhead to the dynamic and evolving nature of data streams generated from non-stationary functions. Our method, M3, is based on a weighted majority ensemble of heterogeneous model types where model weights are updated on-line using Reinforcement Learning techniques. We compare our method with current leading algorithms as implemented in the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) framework using UCI benchmark and synthetic stream generator data sets, and find that our method shows particularly strong gain over the baseline method when ground truth is of limited availability to the classifiers.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data pre processingclassifiertraining setaccuracy and precisionpredictiondata stream miningbig datadata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

Scalable SVM-Based Classification in Dynamic Graphs,Yibo Yao (Washington State University)Lawrence B. Holder (Washington State University),"2120289518,639663078","With the emergence of networked data, graph classification has received considerable interest during the past years. Most approaches to graph classification focus on designing effective kernels to compute similarities for static graphs. However, they become computationally intractable in terms of time and space when a graph is presented in a incremental fashion with continuous updates, i.e., Insertions of nodes and edges. In this paper, we examine the problem of classification in large-scale and incrementally changing graphs. To this end, a framework combining an incremental Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (W-L) graph kernel has been proposed to study this problem. By retaining the support vectors from each learning step, the classification model is incrementally updated whenever new changes are made to the subject graph. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based sub graph extraction strategy to select informative neighbor nodes and discard those with less discriminative power, to facilitate an effective classification process. We demonstrate the advantages of our learning techniques by conducting an empirical evaluation on two large-scale real-world graph datasets. The experimental results also validate the benefits of our sub graph extraction method when combined with the incremental learning techniques.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: graph kernelgraphkernelsupport vector machineentropypredictive modellingpredictiondata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics

Such a low-dimensional representation is extremely useful, because it allows us to visualize the relationships between the various objects of a cluster. However, previous methods of subspace, correlation or projected clustering determine an individual subspace for each cluster. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is even much more valuable to find clusters in one common low-dimensional subspace, because then we can study not only the intra-cluster but also the inter-cluster relationships of objects, and the relationships of the whole clusters to each other.

Intuitively, the multiple labels are usually correlated in some semantic space while sharing the same input space. As a consequence, the multi-label learning process can be augmented significantly by exploiting the label correlations effectively. Most of the existing approaches share the limitations in that the label correlations are typically taken as prior knowledge, which may not depict the true dependencies among labels correctly, or they do not adequately address the issue of missing labels. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that learns the correlations among labels while training the multi-label model simultaneously. Specifically, a low rank structure is adopted to capture the complex correlations among labels.

These data are not missing completely at random, so ignoring the missing values can lead to bias and error during data mining. However, current methods for imputing missing values have yet to account for the fact that variables are correlated and that those relationships exist across time. To address this, we propose an imputation method (FLk-NN) that incorporates time lagged correlations both within and across variables by combining two imputation methods, based on an extension to k-NN and the Fourier transform. This enables imputation of missing values even when all data at a time point is missing and when there are different types of missingness both within and across variables. In comparison to other approaches on two biological datasets (simulated glucose in Type 1 diabetes and multi-modality neurological ICU monitoring) the proposed method has the highest imputation accuracy.

Existing approaches often either discard the uncertainty information, or map the data to a low-dimensional subspace where their associations with multiple labels are obscured. In this paper, we propose a novel visual mining technique, UnTangle, for visualizing uncertain multi-labels. In our proposed visualization, data items are placed inside a web of connected triangles, with labels assigned to the triangle vertices such that nearby labels are more relevant to each other. The positions of the data items are determined based on the probabilistic associations between items and labels. UnTangle provides both (a) an automatic label placement algorithm, and (b) adaptive interaction mechanisms that allow users to control the label positioning for different visual queries. Our work makes a unique contribution by providing an effective way to investigate the relationship between data items and their uncertain labels, as well as the relationships among labels.

In this paper, we examine how the data distribution can be exploited to measure dissimilarity between two instances and propose a new data dependent dissimilarity measure called 'mp-dissimilarity'. Rather than relying on geometric distance, it measures the dissimilarity between two instances in each dimension as a probability mass in a region that encloses the two instances. It deems the two instances in a sparse region to be more similar than two instances in a dense region, though these two pairs of instances have the same geometric distance. Our empirical results show that the proposed dissimilarity measure indeed provides a reliable nearest neighbour search in high dimensional spaces, particularly in sparse data.

In this paper, we focused on relations between thinking time and writing time in handwriting, and proposed to model the relation by externalization, classification, relation, transportation and systematization, which are elements to make sentences. The relation depended on questions and formats of sheets. When sheets give participants the question answered by sentences, writing time become longer as thinking time is longer. On the other hand, if sheets give the question which could be answered only by words, writing time become shorter as thinking time is longer. We hypothesized that participants spent more time classifying, relating and transporting words in answering only by words than in answering by sentences. We could also confirm that when the same questions were given twice, writing time became longer and thinking time became shorter second time than first time. It was because enough externalizations were performed first time and participants spent less time externalizing second time.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: metacognitionwritingtransportcorrelationcognitionplanningsystems modelingartificial intelligencecomputer science
Threatening Privacy across Social Graphs: A Structural Features Approach,Priya Govindan (Rutgers University)Tina Eliassi-Rad (Rutgers University)Jin XuShawndra Hill (New York University)Chris Volinsky (AT&T Labs),"2234161630,218538652,2434352034,2715370296,130248871","Can privacy of individuals in an anonymized social graph be threatened by a handful of structural features i.e., Without knowledge of link-level connectivity? The answer is yes. We define threatening privacy as being able to narrow down each anonymized individual's identity to a small set of known individuals that is most likely to include the anonymized individual. We call this set the Identity+ or I+ set. In this manner, some anonymized individuals get associated with smaller I+ sets and others to larger I+ sets. This distinction is how their privacy is threatened. To find I+ sets, we utilize (1) the structural features released in the anonymized graph (such as a node's degree, clustering coefficient, and average degree of neighbors) and (2) information in an auxiliary (publicly available) graph. To our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind that only uses structural features of graphs for deanonymization. Previous works assume the adjacency matrix of the anonymized graph is released and hence rely on the sparsity of the human behavior exhibited in the adjacency matrix. We will show that structural features are not sparse (i.e., Have few zero entries). In fact, there are many lookalikes when one only inspects structural features. Our proposed approach, RRID+, recursively clusters and matches structural features of the anonymized and auxiliary graphs in a top-down greedy manner. Averaged over a range of real graphs, RRID+ is able to find the correct cluster in the auxiliary data for 37% of the individuals (i.e., Recall = 37%) and narrow down their identity to 26% of the population in the auxiliary data (i.e., Precision on recalled nodes = 74%). Our experiment -- involving multiple synthetic and real graphs plus different noise models (between the anonymized and auxiliary graphs -- showcase how various parameters can affect precision and recall.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: sparse matrixprivacyfeature extractionnoisetheoretical computer sciencedata miningmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics
A Comparison of Approaches to Chinese Word Segmentation in Hadoop,Zhangang WangBangjie Meng,"2511021158,2222993401","Today, we're surrounded by data especially Chinese information. The exponential growth of data first presented challenges to cutting-edge businesses such as Alibaba, Jingdong, Amazon, and Microsoft. They need to go through terabytes and petabytes of data to figure out which websites were popular, what books were in demand, and what kinds of ads appealed to people. Chinese word segmentation is a computer problem in Chinese information processing, and the Chinese word segmentation algorithm is one of the core, but because of the different characteristics of the environment morpheme in English, making the Chinese must solve word problems. Chinese lexical analysis is the foundation and key Chinese information processing. IKAnalyzer (IK) and ICTCLAS (IC) is a very popular Chinese word segmentation algorithm. At present, these two algorithms in Chinese segmentation play an important role in solving the text data. If the two algorithms are well applied to Hadoop distributed environment, will have better performance. In this paper we compare IK and IC algorithm performance by the theory and experiments. This paper reports the experimental work on the mass Chinese text segmentation problem and its optimal solution using Hadoop cluster, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage and using parallel processing to process large data sets using Map Reduce programming framework. We have done prototype implementation of Hadoop cluster, HDFS storage and Map Reduce framework for processing large text data sets by considering prototype of big data application scenarios. The results obtained from various experiments indicate favorable results of above IC and IK algorithm to address mass Chinese text segmentation problem.

This proposed method segments text documents by evaluating similarity between sentences. It is generally difficult to calculate semantic similarity between words that comprise sentences when the domain knowledge is insufficient. This problem influences segmentation accuracy. To address this problem, we use word 2 vec to calculate semantic similarity between words. Using word 2 vec, we embed semantic relationships between words in a vector space by training with large domain-independent corpora. Furthermore, we combine semantic and collocation similarities, i.e., The features between words within a document. The proposed method applies this combined similarity to affinity propagation clustering. Similarity between sentences is defined based on the earth mover's distance between the frequencies of the obtained topical clusters. After calculating similarity between sentences, segmentation boundaries are automatically optimized using dynamic programming. The experimental results obtained using two datasets show that the proposed method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art domain-independent approaches and obtains equal performance with state-of-the-art domain-dependent approaches such as those that use topic modeling.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: scale space segmentationsemantic similaritycorrelationmeasurementsemanticsdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics

The problem has important societal applications such as land cover classification but is challenging due to existence of class ambiguity from spatial heterogeneity, i.e., Samples with the same feature values may have distinct class labels in different areas. Many existing approaches are non-spatial ensembles (e.g., Bagging, boosting, random forest), which assume that learning samples follow an identical distribution. Some spatial ensemble approaches also exist, which simply partition the raster framework into several regular sub-blocks and combine classification results on each sub-block. However, these existing approaches can not address the class ambiguity issue among pixels. In contrast, this paper proposes a new spatial ensemble approach, which partitions the spatial framework into several spatial footprints to minimize class ambiguity of training samples and then learns a base classifier for each footprint. Experimental evaluations on a real world remote sensing dataset show that the proposed spatial ensemble approach outperforms existing approaches when strong class ambiguity exists.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: spatial heterogeneityvegetationboostingdecision treeaccuracy and precisiondata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science

In this paper, we show that high dimensionality of data, at least under some assumptions, helps improving the assessment of the performance of a model, trained with empirical data in supervised classification tasks. In particular, we propose to create copies of the original dataset, where, however, only subsets of independent and informative features are considered in turn: we show that training and combining a collection of classifiers on these sets help filling the gap between the true and the estimated error of the models.

Structural Bregman Distance Functions Learning to Rank with Self-Reinforcement,Te Pi (Zhejiang University)Xi Li (Zhejiang University)Zhongfei Zhang (Zhejiang University),"2225053285,2638293203,2177285464","Learning to rank is an important task for many data mining applications. Essentially, the goal of learning to rank is to learn an appropriate similarity or distance metric to determine the relevance relationships among data points. However, most of the existing approaches for distance metric learning are limited in three aspects. First, they often assume a fixed form of distance metric for the entire input space. Second, the assumed distance functions are often computationally expensive or even intractable to learn for high dimensional data, such as Mahalanobis distance. Third, most of these approaches lack robustness to noisily labeled data, which is pervasive in many real-world applications. In this paper, we study learning to rank as a problem of distance metric learning to address the above three problems. We choose Bregman distance as the target distance function, due to its general functional form as a generalization of a wide class of distance functions, and its capacity of exploiting complicated nonlinear patterns underlying the data. Under the framework of structural SVM, we formulate the problem of learning Bregman distance functions for ranking as a QP problem by a nonparametric approach, and present an effective algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a self-reinforcement scheme that adaptively differentiates each data point in the role of learning to secure the robustness. We emphasize that the proposed method SBLR-S (Structural Bregman distance functions Learning to Rank with Self-reinforcement) is more general than the conventional distance metric learning approaches, and is able to handle high dimensional data as well as noisily labeled data.

The methods for evaluating the quality of spectral unmixing are usually based on the reference objects: a set of pixels where one of the signals is present while another is absent. However, reference objects are not always readily available, particularly in experiments that involve multi-colour fluorescence reporters. Moreover, there is little discussion about how we select training data to estimate the cross-talk coefficients of spectral unmixing methods.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to data fusion using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). In applying to data fusion, RBMs are able to model hidden patterns lying behind the two datasets with bipartite graph structure between hidden variables and observable ones. There is a bottleneck in the application of RBMs to data fusion: It is computationally expensive to learn RBMs from data with missing values. Therefore, we propose a new efficient algorithm for learning RBMs from missing data. This algorithm maximizes the lower bound on the observation likelihood, which can efficiently be computed.

The Gaussian distribution is commonly used as a search operator in most of the EDA methods. However there are indications in the literature that heavy tailed distributions may perform better due to their higher exploration capabilities. Univariate heavy tailed distributions were already proposed for high dimensional problems. In 2D problems it has been reported that a multivariate heavy tailed (such as Cauchy) search distribution is able to blend together the strengths of multivariate modelling with a high exploration power. In this paper, we study whether a similar scheme would work well in high dimensional search problems. To get around of the difficulty of multivariate model building in high dimensions we employ a recently proposed random projections (RP) ensemble based approach which we modify to get samples from a multivariate Cauchy using the scale-mixture representation of the Cauchy distribution. Our experiments show that the resulting RP-based multivariate Cauchy EDA consistently improves on the performance of the univariate Cauchy search distribution. However, intriguingly, the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA has the best performance among these methods. It appears that the highly explorative nature of the multivariate Cauchy sampling is exacerbated in high dimensional search spaces and the population based search loses its focus and effectiveness as a result. Finally, we present an idea to increase exploration while maintaining exploitation and focus by using the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA in which the RP matrices are drawn with i.i.d.

New affinity matrices are defined to measure similarities among users, among items, and across items and users. Furthermore, the similarities are assessed at multiple levels of granularity allowing individual and group level similarities. These affinity matrices thus produce multiresolution groupings of items and users, and in turn lead to higher accuracy in matching similar context for ratings, and more accurate prediction of new ratings.

Exploring Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Models via Non-negative Matrix Factorization,Chengbin Peng (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology)Ka Chun Wong (University of Toronto),"2505722984,2107363502","Many real-world phenomena can be modeled by networks in which entities and connections are represented by nodes and edges respectively. When certain nodes are highly connected with each other, those nodes forms a cluster, which is called community in our context. It is usually assumed that each node belongs to one community only, but evidences in biology and social networks reveal that the communities often overlap with each other. In other words, one node can probably belong to multiple communities. In light of that, mixed membership stochastic block models (MMB) have been developed to model those networks with overlapping communities. Such a model contains three matrices: two incidence matrices indicating in and out connections and one probability matrix. When the probability of connections for nodes between communities are significantly small, the parameter inference problem to this model can be solved by a constrained non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. In this paper, we explore the connection between the two models and propose an algorithm based on NMF to infer the parameters of MMB. The proposed algorithms can detect overlapping communities regardless of knowing or not the number of communities. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve a better community detection performance than the traditional NMF algorithm.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: community structuresymmetric matrixcluster analysiscomputational modelstochastic processtheoretical computer sciencedata miningmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

In this paper, we focus on the problem of performing multi-label classification on social media data, where the user generated contents are associated with multiple labels. Multi-label learning studies the problem where each object is represented by a single instance and associated with a set of labels. Current multi-label learning algorithms mainly exploit label correlations globally, by assuming that the label correlations are shared by all the examples. In real applications, however, different examples may share different label correlations. In this paper, we propose a Local Pair wise Label Correlation (LPLC) method for social media content categorization. We try to exploit the strongest local pair wise label correlations between the ground truth labels for each training example by computing the maximum conditional probabilities. If two labels have strong correlation, there will be a larger conditional probability of one label given by another. In the training stage, we find the most correlated labels for ground truth labels of each training example. In the test stage, we make prediction through maximizing the posterior probability, which is estimated with the distribution of each label in the k nearest neighbors and their most correlated local pair wise label correlations. We compare our method with six well-established multi-label learning algorithms over nine data sets from different social media data domains and scales.

Sequential Pattern Analysis with Right Granularity,Chuanren Liu (Rutgers University)Kai Zhang (NEC)Hui Xiong (Rutgers University),"2169554947,2600447970,2153710278","Sequential pattern analysis targets on finding statistically relevant temporal structures where the values are delivered in a sequence. This is a fundamental problem in data mining with diversified applications in many science and business fields, such as multimedia analysis (motion gesture/video sequence recognition), marketing analytics (buying path prediction), and financial modelling (trend of stock prices). Given the overwhelming scale and the heterogeneous nature of the sequential data, new techniques for sequential pattern analysis are required to derive competitive advantages and unlock the power of the big data. In this dissertation, we develop novel approaches for sequential pattern analysis with applications in dynamic business environments, including operation and management tasks in healthcare industry as well as B2B (Business-to-Business) marketing. Our major contribution is to identify the right granularity for sequential pattern analysis, including both sequential pattern modelling and mining. Due to space limitation, this submission presents mainly the ""temporal skeletonization"", our approach to identifying the meaningful granularity for sequential pattern mining. Our key idea is to summarize the temporal correlations in an undirected graph. Then, the ""skeleton"" of the graph serves as a higher granularity on which hidden temporal patterns are more likely to be identified. In the meantime, the embedding topology of the graph allows us to translate the rich temporal content into a metric space. This opens up new possibilities to explore, quantify, and visualize sequential data. Our approach has shown to provide substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art methods in challenging tasks of sequential pattern mining and sequence clustering. Evaluation on a Business-to-Business (B2B) marketing application demonstrates that our approach can effectively discover critical buying paths from noisy customer event data.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingdata visualizationdata sciencedata miningmachine learningcomputer science

Neural Conditional Energy Models for Multi-label Classification,How Jing (National Taiwan University)Shou-De Lin (National Taiwan University),"2130760235,2114357324","Multi-label classification (MLC) is a type of structured output prediction problems where a given instance can be associated to more than one labels at a time. From the probabilistic point of view, a model predicts a set of labels y given an input vector v by learning a conditional distribution p(y|v). This paper presents a powerful model called a Neural Conditional Energy Model (NCEM) to solve MLC. The model can be viewed as a hybrid deterministic-stochastic network of which we use a deterministic neural network to transform the input data, before contributing to the energy landscape of v, y, and a single stochastic hidden layer h. Non-linear transformation given by the neural network makes our model more expressive and more capable of capturing complex relations between input and output, and using deterministic neurons facilitates exact inference. We present an efficient learning algorithm that is simple to implement. We conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets from wide variety of domains with various evaluation metrics to confirm that NCEM is significantly superior to current state-of-the-art models most of the time based on pair-wise t-test at 5% significance level.

We study the problem of semantic coherent retrieval, where documents from different modalities should be ranked by the semantic relevance to the queries.

Therefore, semantic coherence and a better bias-variance trade-off can be achieved by TINA.

Previous BN structure learning algorithms treat variables with similar tendency separately. In this paper, we propose a grouped sparse Gaussian BN (GSGBN) structure learning algorithm which creates BN based on three assumptions: (i) variables follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution, (ii) the network only contains a few edges (sparse), (iii) similar variables have less-divergent sets of parents, while not-so-similar ones should have divergent sets of parents (variable grouping). We use L1 regularization to make the learned network sparse, and another term to incorporate shared information among variables. For similar variables, GSGBN tends to penalize the differences of similar variables' parent sets more, compared to those not-so-similar variables' parent sets. The similarity of variables is learned from the data by alternating optimization, without prior domain knowledge. Based on this new definition of the optimal BN, a coordinate descent algorithm and a projected gradient descent algorithm are developed to obtain edges of the network and also similarity of variables.

A promising approach is to discover invariant relationships among the monitoring data and generate invariant networks, where a node is a monitoring data source (metric) and a link indicates an invariant relationship between two monitoring data. Such an invariant network representation can help system experts to localize and diagnose the system faults by examining those broken invariant relationships and their related metrics, because system faults usually propagate among the monitoring data and eventually lead to some broken invariant relationships. However, at one time, there are usually a lot of broken links (invariant relationships) within an invariant network. Without proper guidance, it is difficult for system experts to manually inspect this large number of broken links. Thus, a critical challenge is how to effectively and efficiently rank metrics (nodes) of invariant networks according to the anomaly levels of metrics. The ranked list of metrics will provide system experts with useful guidance for them to localize and diagnose the system faults. To this end, we propose to model the nodes and the broken links as a Markov Random Field (MRF), and develop an iteration algorithm to infer the anomaly of each node based on belief propagation (BP).

Automatic Learning Common Definitional Patterns from Multi-domain Wikipedia Pages,Jingsong ZhangYinglin WangDingyu Yang,"2117379318,2682109600,2625753187","Automatic definition extraction has attracted wide interest in NLP domain and knowledge-based applications. One primary task of definition extraction is mining patterns from definitional sentences. Existing extraction methods of definitional patterns, either focus on manual extraction by intuition or observation, or aim to mine intricate definitional patterns by automatic extraction methods. The manual method requires large human resources to identify the definitional patterns because of diverse lexico-syntactic structures. It inevitable suffers poor behavior especially the extraction from cross-domain corpora. The latter method mainly considers the precision in definition extraction, which is at the cost of decreasing the recall of definitions. Both of them are unsuitable for cross-domain definition extraction. To address those issues, this paper proposes a solution to perform the automatic extraction of definitional patterns from multi-domain definitional sentences of Wikipedia. Our method FIND-SS is modified based on FIND-S algorithm and solves the definition extraction problems of cross-domain corpora. Find-SS adopts a ""the more similar the higher priority"" scheme to improve the learning performance. It can accommodate some noisy information and does not require any pattern seeds for pattern learning. The experimental results indicate that our scenario is significantly superior to previous method.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: encyclopediathe internetupper and lower boundselectronic publishingdata sciencedata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics
Document-Specific Keyphrase Extraction Using Sequential Patterns with Wildcards,Fei Xie (Hefei University of Technology)Xindong Wu (Hefei University of Technology)Xingquan Zhu (Florida Atlantic University),"2683002994,2123651450,2618356905","Finding good key phrases for a document is beneficial for many applications, such as text summarization, browsing, and indexing.

Our key innovation is to use wildcards (or gap constraints) to help extract sequential patterns, where the flexible wildcard constraints within a pattern can capture semantic relationships between words. To achieve this goal, we regard each single document as a sequential dataset, and propose an efficient algorithm to mine sequential patterns with wildcard and one-off conditions that allows important key phrases to be captured during the mining process. For each extracted key phrase candidate, we use some statistical pattern features to characterize it. A supervised learning classifier is trained to identify key phrases from a test document.

Classification by CUT: Clearance under Threshold,Ryan McBride (Simon Fraser University)Ke Wang (Simon Fraser University)Wenyuan Li (BC Hydro),"2327477343,2626264286,2169681711","Identifying bad objects hidden amidst many good objects is important for public safety and decision-making. These problems are complicated in that the cost of leaving a bad object unidentified may not be specified easily, making it difficult to apply existing cost-sensitive classification that depends on knowing a cost matrix or cost distribution. A compelling case for this ""illusive cost"" issue is presented in our project of identifying contaminated transformers with an industrial partner. To address this problem, we present an alternative formulation of cost-sensitive classification, Clearance Under Threshold (CUT) Classification. Given a training set, CUT classification is to partition the attribute space such that a partition is cleared if the probability of a future object in this partition being bad is less than a user-specified threshold. The goal is to clear many low-risk objects so that users can more effectively target high-risk objects. We present a solution to this problem and evaluate it on a case study for clearing contaminated transformers and on public benchmarks from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.

We propose a semi-supervised opinion stream classification algorithm that uses only an initial training set of labeled documents for polarity learning and gradually adapts to changes in the vocabulary. In particular, our algorithm S×3 Learner starts with the vocabulary of opinionated words that are in the documents of the initial training set, and then expands it with new words, as soon as there is enough evidence for estimating their polarity.

Node-Specific Triad Pattern Mining for Complex-Network Analysis,Marco Winkler (University of Würzburg)Joerg Reichardt (University of Würzburg),"2427317774,2182961668","The mining of graphs in terms of their local substructureis a well-established methodology to analyze networks. It was hypothesized that motifs - sub graph patterns which appear significantly more often than expected at random - play a key role for the ability of a system to perform its task.

Therefore, it remains unclear whether motifs are overrepresented in the whole system or only in certain regions. In this contribution, we overcome this limitation by mining node-specific triad patterns. For every vertex, the abundance of each triad pattern is considered only in triads it participates in.

This paper investigated the impact of walking environments on gait monitoring and analysis. A tri-axial accelerometer attached to subject's lower back was used to record gait pattern while walking in 5 different urban environments (quiet street, busy street, cobbled street, dark street and checkerboard floor). Forty-one young students participated the experiment. For each trial, a total of 33 gait features were extracted, of which 11 were derived from the entire walking trial and 22 were computed for each stride cycle. Statistics analysis showed that 7 out of 11 features extracted from each trial were significantly different across the five environments. The obtained results suggested that different environments have various impacts on gait features extracted from accelerometer data. To further access the impact, a multi-layer perceptrons based hierarchical classification approach was proposed to discriminate stride cycles taken from different walking environments. The classification accuracy of each level ranged from 98.26% to 65.62% with the discrimination of walking in quiet environment achieving the best performance.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: accelerationdata miningsimulation

High Dimensional Matrix Relevance Learning,Frank-Michael Schleif (University of Birmingham)Thomas Villmann (Leipzig University)Xibin Zhu (Citec),"2004635363,2173309013,2113424167","In supervised learning the parameters of a parametric Euclidean distance or mahalanobis distance can be effectively learned by so called Matrix Relevance Learning. This adaptation is not only useful to improve the discrimination capabilities of the model, but also to identify relevant features or relevant correlated features in the input data. Classical Matrix Relevance Learning scales quadratic with the number of input dimensions M and becomes prohibitive if M exceeds some thousand input features. We address Matrix Relevance Learning for data with a very large number of input dimensions. Such high dimensional data occur frequently in the life sciences domain e.g. For microarray or spectral data.

The second novel approximation scheme is based on the Nystroem approximation and is exact if the number of Eigen values equals the rank of the Relevance Matrix.

Because Sentic Net was created specifically for opinion mining in English language, however, its localization can be very laborious. In this work, a toolkit for creating non-English versions of Sentic Net in a time- and cost-effective way is proposed. This is achieved by exploiting online facilities such as Web dictionaries and translation engines. The challenging issues are three: firstly, when a Web lexicon is used, one sentiment concept in English can usually be mapped to multiple concepts in the local language. In this work, we develop a concept disambiguation algorithm to discover context within texts in the target language. Secondly, the polarity of some concepts in the local language may be different from the counterpart in English, which is referred to as language-dependent sentiment concepts. An algorithm is developed to detect sentiment conflict using sentiment annotation corpora in the two languages. Lastly, some sentiment concepts are not included in the local language after dictionary consulting and online translation. In this work, we develop a tool to extract these concepts from sentiment dictionary in the local language.

Stability-Based Stopping Criterion for Active Learning,Wenquan Wang (Shanghai Jiao Tong University)Wenbin Cai (Shanghai Jiao Tong University)Ya Zhang (Shanghai Jiao Tong University),"2228073806,2715687992,2627125993","While active learning has drawn broad attention in recent years, there are relatively few studies on stopping criterion for active learning. We here propose a novel model stability based stopping criterion, which considers the potential of each unlabeled examples to change the model once added to the training set. The underlying motivation is that active learning should terminate when the model does not change much by adding remaining examples. Inspired by the widely used stochastic gradient update rule, we use the gradient of the loss at each candidate example to measure its capability to change the classifier. Under the model change rule, we stop active learning when the changing ability of all remaining unlabeled examples is less than a given threshold. We apply the stability-based stopping criterion to two popular classifiers: logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs). It can be generalized to a wide spectrum of learning models. Substantial experimental results on various UCI benchmark data sets have demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-art methods in most cases.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: online machine learningstabilityearly stoppingactive learningdata modelingbenchmarklogisticssupport vector machinestabilityactive learningsemi supervised learningdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Instead, SIC can discover the clusters number automatically based on the distribution of input data and separate these clusters effectively. In each iteration of SIC, a new cluster containing one randomly selected object is created and then this cluster increases by merging itself with the other objects or clusters near-by if certain criterion is satisfied.

Webb (Monash University),2126304162,"Discretization of streaming data has received surprisingly little attention. This might be because streaming data require incremental discretization with cut points that may vary over time and this is perceived as undesirable. We argue, to the contrary, that it can be desirable for a discretization to evolve in synchronization with an evolving data stream, even when the learner assumes that attribute values' meanings remain invariant over time. We examine the issues associated with discretization in the context of distribution drift and develop computationally efficient incremental discretization algorithms.

A great many algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of recommendation, but until recently the long tail problem rising from inadequate recommendation of niche items is recognized as a real challenge to a recommender. This is particularly true for ultra-massive online retailers who usually have tremendous niche goods for sale. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a pattern-based method called CORE for flexible recommendation of both popular and niche items. CORE has two notable features compared with various existing recommenders. First, it is superior to previous pattern-based methods by adopting cosine rather than frequent patterns for recommendation. This helps filter out spurious cross-support patterns harmful to recommendation. Second, compared with some benchmark methods such as SVD and LDA, CORE does well in niche item recommendation given particularly heavy tailed data sets. Indeed, the coupled configuration of the support and cosine measures enables CORE to switch freely between recommending popular and niche items. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE especially in long tail recommendation.

As a result, ad hoc heuristics have to be employed to design different joint feature mapping functions for different applications, which results in the lackness of generalization ability for multiple output prediction. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose to augment Lasso with output by decoupling the joint feature mapping function of traditional structured learning. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) The augmented Lasso conducts regression and variable selection on both the input and output features, and thus the learned model could fit an output with both the selected input variables and the other correlated outputs. 2) To be more general, we set up nonlinear dependencies among output variables by generalized Lasso. 3) Moreover, the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) with Alternating Direction Minimizing (ADM) strategy is used to find the optimal model parameters.

Privacy-Preserving Queries over Outsourced Data with Access Pattern Protection,Shun-Pun Li (The Chinese University of Hong Kong)Man Hon Wong (The Chinese University of Hong Kong),"2223384949,2698298504","One of the concerns about database outsourcing is that the service provider may not be trustworthy. Besides protecting data against outsiders, it is necessary to hide sensitive information from the service provider. For single-server environments, data encryption is commonly used to protect data confidentiality. To use server computational resources for processing queries, data are encrypted in tuple-level. Indexing tags are computed and attached to the encrypted tuples such that the server can check if an encrypted tuple satisfies the query predicate without learning exact data values. However, with additional information of some time-based events, service providers can still infer information of the encrypted data through query access patterns if there are observed linkages between the access patterns and the time-based events. In this paper, we study the problem of information disclosure in such a scenario. We first illustrate how to launch the inference attack. Then, we formally define the problem and propose techniques for protecting access privacy. Instead of providing total privacy with a high overhead, our approach aims to lower the confidence of service providers' inferences.

In this paper, we present a scalable topology discovery approach using Giraph platform and perform (i) graph structural analysis and (ii) graph mining. For graph structural analysis, we consider various centrality measures. First, we find top-K centrality vertices for a specific topology (e.g. Star, ring and mesh). Next, we find other vertices which are in the neighborhood of top centrality vertices and then create the cluster based on structural density. We compare our clustering approach with DBSCAN algorithm on the basis of modularity parameter. The results show that clusters generated through structural density parameter are better in quality than generated through neighborhood density parameter.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: alpha centralitycentralitynetwork sciencebetweenness centralitynetwork theorynetwork topologycluster analysisapproximation algorithmtheoretical computer sciencedata miningmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics
Two-Phase Attribute Ordering for Unsupervised Ranking of Multi-attribute Objects,Chun-Guo LiXing Mei (Hebei University)Bao-Gang Hu (Chinese Academy of Sciences),"2703586441,2599702889,2136579004","Unsupervised ranking faces a problem of distinguishing those critical attributes to ranking. Prior knowledge of ranking might open a new door for this problem. By embedding the ranking prior information, strictly monotonicity and smoothness, this paper presents a two-phase attribute selection procedure for unsupervised ranking. The first phase identifies those irrelevant attributes based on mean Spearman Ranking Correlation Coefficients (SRCCs) of pairs of attributes by knowing that relevant attributes are assumed to be monotone with each other if it is monotone with the ranking score. The second phase carries out Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) on a learned ranking rule and provides the total effect for each attribute to ranking. Finally, the most important attribute to ranking are selected to perform ranking.

Commonsense Knowledge as the Glue in a Hybrid Model of Computational Creativity,Andres Gomez de Silva Garza (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México)Erik Cambria (Nanyang Technological University)Rafael Perez Y. Perez (Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana),"2109804665,1974519269,2099208633","In this paper, we describe on-going work on the ensemble of two models for computational creativity using commonsense knowledge. The GENCAD model of computational creativity proposes the use of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that employs a population of exemplars as a starting point for its search, unlike traditional EAs, which employ a randomly-generated initial population. The EA, operating on this population, is then used to generate new potentially creative solutions. GENCAD has been instantiated in the domains of structural design of tall buildings and feng shui-compliant residential floor-plan design. The MEXICA model of computational creativity also begins with a set of exemplars as a starting point, but it analyzes these exemplars based on a domain theory. The generalized model that is obtained from analyzing the set of exemplars is then used to guide the generation of new solutions. MEXICA has been instantiated in the domain of plot generation for stories involving themes, characters and locations from the Mexica culture of ancient Mexico. In the hybrid model, we combine the two original models to generate plots for stories of the same sort that MEXICA generates, but using GENCAD's process model to do so.

Besides the physiological properties of pathogenes and hosts, the social contacts of host population, which characterize individuals' reciprocal exposures of infection in view of demographical structures and various social activities, are also pivotal to understand and further predict the prevalence of infectious diseases. The means of measuring social contacts will dominate the extent how precisely we can forecast the dynamics of infections in the real world. Most current works focus their efforts on modeling the spatial patterns of static social contacts. In this work, we address the problem on how to characterize and measure dynamical social contacts during an epidemic from a novel perspective. We propose an epidemic-model-based tensor deconvolution framework to address this issue, in which the spatiotemporal patterns of social contacts are represented by the factors of tensors, which can be discovered by a tensor deconvolution procedure with an integration of epidemic models from rich types of data, mainly including heterogeneous outbreak surveillance, social-demographic census and physiological data from medical reports.

Metric Factorization for Exploratory Analysis of Complex Data,Claudia Plant (Florida State University),2122910652,"How to explore complex data? Often, several representations for each data object are available, the data are described by attributes of heterogeneous data type and/or each data object is characterized by many features. It is difficult to choose a suitable similarity measure and an appropriate data mining technique to get an unbiased overview on the information contained in complex data. In this paper, we introduce Metric Factorization as a novel data mining task. The goal of Metric Factorization is to discover the major alternative views of complex data. Our novel algorithm MF extends matrix factorization techniques to support metric data. We do not need to choose a single similarity measure but can just input any available metric. Metric Factorization builds automatically interesting basis spaces from a large variety of input metrics. Due to metric properties, the basis spaces can be further explored with standard techniques like Multidimensional Scaling. We relate the Metric Factorization task to data compression and demonstrate how ideas from information theory (Minimum Description Length principle) make the parametrization of MF optional.

If we presume each choice making as the formation of link between subjects and options, immediately CM can be bridged to link analysis and prediction (LAP) problem. However, such a mapping is often not trivial and straightforward. In LAP problems, the only available observations are links among objects but their attributes are often inaccessible. Therefore, we extend CM into a latent feature space to avoid the need of explicit attributes. Moreover, LAP is usually based on binary linkage assumption that models observed links as positive instances and unobserved links as negative instances. Instead, we use a weaker assumption that treats unobserved links as pseudo negative instances. Furthermore, most subjects or options may be quite heterogeneous due to the long-tail distribution, which is failed to capture by conventional LAP approaches. To address above challenges, we propose a Bayesian heteroskedastic choice model to represent the non-identically distributed linkages in the LAP problems.

Supervised Adaptive-Transfer PLSA for Cross-Domain Text Classification,Rui ZhaoKezhi Mao,"2695234671,2690223367","Cross-domain learning is a very promising technique to improve classification in the target (testing) domain whose data distributions are very different from the source (training) domain. Many cross-domain text classification methods are built on topic modeling approaches. However, topic model methods are unsupervised in nature without fully utilizing the label information of the source domain. In addition, almost all cross-domain learning approaches utilize the knowledge of source domain in the later stage of the training process, and this limits the knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a model named Supervised Adaptive transfer Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (SAtPLSA) for cross-domain text classification aiming to deal with the above two issues. The proposed model extends the original PLSA to a supervised learning paradigm. By defining the common labeled information from each term across domains, we transfer knowledge in source domain to assist classifying text in target domain. In addition, we adaptively modify the weight value controlling the proportion of the usage of knowledge from source domain in the model learning process. At last, we conducted experiments on nine benchmark datasets in cross domain text classification to compare the performance of our proposed algorithm with two classical supervised learning methods and five state-of-art transfer learning approaches.

However the high retrieval cost of data used in prediction is a big challenge due to the large amount of users and contents involved. We propose a notion that higher popularity user-generated contents can be predicted by concentrating on fewer but informative users, as we notice the fact that contents generated by those users tend to become popular while that which are generated by the rest users do not. We develop a cost-effective popularity prediction framework to fulfil online prediction. It contains 3 modules: (a) online data retrieving, (b) informative users selection and (c) popularity prediction. A hybrid user selection algorithm and several popularity prediction algorithms/improvements are presented, and their performance are evaluated and compared using (a) the selected users' generated data and (b) all users' generated data, retrieved from Sina Weibo Micro blogger. The best prediction algorithm reaches a 78% accuracy at the time of 24 hours after publishing time when level width Nl equals 500. And the best combination of prediction and selection algorithms performs only about 7% worse on dataset of 2000 users than on dataset of all users (about 4.46 million).",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: user generated contentaccuracy and precisionpredictive modellingthe internetpredictioninternet privacyworld wide webdata miningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Previous work on fuzzer taming first reduces each test case into a minimal failure-inducing test case using delta debugging, then finds the ordering by applying the Furthest Point First algorithm over the reduced test cases. During the delta debugging process, a sequence of failing test cases is generated (the ""delta debugging trail""). We hypothesize that these additional failing test cases also contain relevant information about the bug and could be useful for fuzzertaming.

The success of an advert is measured based on how users interact with it. In this paper we investigate whether the application of unsupervised learning and association rule mining could be used to enable personalised targeting of mobile adverts with the aim of increasing the interaction rate. Over May and June 2014 we recorded advert interactions such as tapping the advert or watching the whole advert video along with the set of apps a user has installed at the time of the interaction. Based on the apps that the users have installed we applied k-means clustering to profile the users into one of ten classes. Due to the large number of apps considered we implemented dimension reduction to reduced the app feature space by mapping the apps to their iTunes category and clustered users based on the percentage of their apps that correspond to each iTunes app category. The clustering was externally validated by investigating differences between the way the ten profiles interact with the various adverts genres (lifestyle, finance and entertainment adverts). In addition association rule mining was performed to find whether the time of the day that the advert is served and the number of apps a user has installed makes certain profiles more likely to interact with the advert genres. The results showed there were clear differences in the way the profiles interact with the different advert genres and the results of this paper suggest that mobile advert targeting would improve the frequency that users interact with an advert.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: mediaassociation rule learningmobile telephonydatabase indexadvertisinghuman computer interactionmultimediaworld wide webtelecommunicationsoperating systemcomputer securitycomputer science

In this paper, rather than using the traditional statistical analysis widely found in balance assessment studies, machine learning techniques were employed to recognize stroke patients and healthy matched subjects based on posturographic features extracted from their COP data. In this context, our main purpose was to investigate the relevance of 16 linear and 9 nonlinear posturographic features commonly examined in the balance assessment field. Thus, the average joint performance among six popular classification methods was evaluated under a 65 instances-size dataset in three situations: using only linear features, only nonlinear features and, finally, linear and nonlinear posturographic features combined. The former situation yielded significantly (P <0.01) better results.

Incorporating Spontaneous Reporting System Data to Aid Causal Inference in Longitudinal Healthcare Data,Jenna Marie Reps (University of Nottingham)Uwe Aickelin (University of Nottingham),"2044421523,269644229","Inferring causality using longitudinal observational databases is challenging due to the passive way the data are collected. The majority of associations found within longitudinal observational data are often non-causal and occur due to confounding. The focus of this paper is to investigate incorporating information from additional databases to complement the longitudinal observational database analysis. We investigate the detection of prescription drug side effects as this is an example of a causal relationship. In previous work a framework was proposed for detecting side effects only using longitudinal data. In this paper we combine a measure of association derived from mining a spontaneous reporting system database to previously proposed analysis that extracts domain expertise features for causal analysis of a UK general practice longitudinal database. The results show that there is a significant improvement to the performance of detecting prescription drug side effects when the longitudinal observation data analysis is complemented by incorporating additional drug safety sources into the framework.

To take the temporal nature of the problem into consideration, we divide the regression problem into a set of sub-tasks of distinct time periods, then the problem can be treated in a multi-task learning framework. Further, we propose a novel regularization term in which we exploit the block sparse structure to augment the robustness of the model. In addition, we incorporate the spatial smoothness over road links and thus achieve a spatial-temporal framework. An accelerated proximal algorithm is adopted to solve the convex but non-smooth problem, which will converge to the global optimum.

Social Preference Ontologies for Enriching User and Item Data in Recommendation Systems,Christopher Krauss (Fraunhofer Society)Stefan Arbanowski (Fraunhofer Society),"2294794511,306424321","Some of the known issues of recommendation algorithms are a result of the so called ""Cold Start Problem"" that is caused by a lack of sufficient data of users, items or the content, which are essential for the calculation of context-sensitive predictions. Along with this comes the ""Sparsity Problem"" which also exposes the problem of recommendation systems which are being provided with too little information of user feedback such as likes and views. As a consequent collaborative and knowledge-based filtering algorithms are unable of precise prediction which is causing a decline of the customer satisfaction. If beyond that there also is a lack of metadata, the calculation of similarities through content-based filtering algorithms is likely to fail as well. This paper introduces preference ontologies and how they help to reduce these issues by analyzing external data, in terms of texts from social networks and other web sources. Thereby we introduce a self-designed semantic engine, performing sentiment analysis and semantic keyword extraction. These novel ontologies represent the mined information and thus, describe the users interest in automatic analyzed topics and map them to the meta data of items in recommendation engines.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: ontologycollaborative filteringfiltersentiment analysissemanticsworld wide webinformation retrievaldata miningcomputer science
Mining of Training Samples for Multiple Learning Machines in Computer-Aided Detection of Lesions in CT Images,Kenji Suzuki (Illinois Institute of Technology),2304091908,"Optimal selection of training samples is very difficult when multiple learning machines are used in classification. We investigated an approach to mining of training samples for multiple learning machines in computer-aided detection of lesions.

The weakness is analyzed in the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) space in classification. The most to least ""difficult"" samples for the seed model are ""mined"" by dividing samples into N groups by the ROC scores. N ML models are trained with the mined N groups of training samples in an ensemble manner. We tested our approach in classification between 25 lesions and 489 non-lesions.

There are usually two main dimension reduction strategies, feature extraction and feature selection. Feature extraction is to create new features to represent documents, whereas feature selection will return a subset of words as features. Comparing two strategies, feature extraction has powerful capacity in reducing dimensionality, but it will lost intuitive semantic for documents. Feature selection has perfect interpretability for text contents, and specially is significant for text dimension reduction, but it is still a difficult work to design a suitable measure for feature evaluation.

Multiple Subscriber-Identity-Module Detection Using Social Network Analysis Techniques,Ahmed Maher (Cairo University)Ahmed Ghoneim (Cairo University),"2690257096,2152403084","Some Telco customers have multiple ""Subscriber-Identity-Modules"" or SIM cards across competing mobile operators or within the same operator. Multi-SIM detection is beneficial to telecommunications operators in tuning campaigns, acquiring usage from competitors, and retaining customers. The goal was to develop and materialize the techniques required to build a model for detecting such customers, and link between the dials of a single customer within the same operator and/or across different operators. The model was based on Social Network Analysis (SNA), which preliminary necessitated representing the social network graph atop the data warehouse that is continuously fed by switches and charging/billing systems, having customers as nodes and their interactions as links. Centrality metrics were calculated for the nodes along with behavioral attributes for the links, to facilitate for equivalence analysis between each pair of nodes. Its steps typically included detecting the common block of nodes touched by each pair of nodes with respect to the degree centrality of both nodes, and analyzing the way each node in the pair interacts with each node in the common block basing on link attributes. False detection is reduced by calculating the diversity of social circles found in the common block between a potential pair, and counting the sub-edges between both nodes in the pair. Resulting metrics are weighted both manually and using linear regression, and then final scores are used to cluster potential pairs into Multi-SIM probability deciles. The SNA-based approach ensured linking to other dials of a single customer even when belonging to a competitor, and market research analysis proved an arbitrary accuracy level reaching almost 90% when targeting the highest 15% ranking customers. Multiple model verification pinpointed a sweet spot that provides an accuracy level of 84% at Multi-SIM base penetration of 76%.

However, since the input weights and bias are randomly assigned and not adjusted, the ELMs model shows an instability if we repeat the experiments many times. Such instability makes the ELMs less reliable than other computational intelligence models. In our investigation, we try to solve this problem by using the Random Production in the first layer of the ELMs. Thus, we can reduce the chance of using random weight assignment in ELMs by removing the bias in the hidden layer.

Recovering Human Mobility Flow Models and Daily Routine Patterns in a Smart Environment,Chen Li (Hong Kong Baptist University)William K. Cheung (Hong Kong Baptist University),"2444561585,2099585548","With the recent advent of ubiquitous computing and sensor technologies, human mobility data can be acquired for monitoring and analysis purposes, e.g., Daily routine identification. Mining mobility data is challenging due to the spatial and temporal variations of the human mobility, even for the same activity. In this paper, we propose a methodology to first summarize indoor human mobility traces as a flow graph using a probabilistic grammar induction algorithm. Then, we recover salient mobility patterns as sub flows in the flow graph. Thus, such patterns/sub flows are expected to be corresponding to the activities that often last for a while, e.g., Cooking and cleaning. The weighted kernel k-means algorithm is adopted for the sub flow extraction. Finally, we detect the occurrences of the sub flows along the mobility traces and obtain their daily routines via the eigen-decomposition. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we applied it to a publicly available smart home data set containing digital traces of an elder living in a smart house for 219 days. We illustrate how the flow graphs, sub flows and daily routine patterns can be inferred from the mobility data.

To address that problem, in this paper we propose a novel connectivity-network-based framework to fuse multiple properties of network features for MCI classification. Specifically, two different types of network features (i.e., Brain region and sub graph) are respectively used to quantify two different properties of networks, where two kinds of feature selection methods are further performed to remove the irrelevant and redundant features. Then, multi-kernel learning technique is adopted on those corresponding selected features to obtain the final classification results. We evaluate our proposed method on a real MCI dataset containing 12 MCI patients and 25 healthy controls.

Specifically, we extend the Conditional Log Likelihood (CLL) objective to a general learning criterion. We prove that, some existing popular training methods can be derived from this generalization, via adjusting the parameters to specific values. Intuitively, the regularization with different settings of parameters constrain the learned RBM distribution in different ways, and the parameter setting that provide a suitable distribution constraints for a particular sample set leads to the optimal performance. Moreover, we show that this generalized criterion actually extends the CLL objective with a Renyi divergence-based regularization. The uniform distribution used in this divergence-based regularization can be replaced by some sample-based distribution. This modification is applicable to any specific case of the general objective, and we call the appended loss as general margin. The proposed generalization enables an effective model selection procedure and experiments on human face recognition and document classification achieved significant performance improvement over the existing learning methods.

TWSVM is a successful algorithm for classification problems which seeks two nonparallel hyper planes to make each hyper plane close to one class and far from the other as much as possible. And Deep Learning (DL) models have shown good ability in feature extraction and dimension reduction by constructing multi-layer network. Since the feature extraction in DL can reduce feature dimension while maintain the main information of original inputs, we consider constructing a three layer network which contains input layer, hidden layer and output layer. We use two TWSVMs in the hidden layer to extract features based on the projection principle which is derived from Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The two TWSVMs will get four hyper planes by solving four convex quadratic programs. A new dataset which consists of the extracted features with four feature dimensions is produced from the hidden layer and then we can input it to the main TWSVM of the output layer to make final prediction.

Merging Classifiers of Different Classification Approaches,Antonina Danylenko (Linnaeus University)Welf Lowe (Linnaeus University),"2050039803,2143134647","Classification approaches, e.g. Decision trees or Naive Bayesian classifiers, are often tightly coupled to learning strategies, special data structures, the type of information captured, and to how common problems, e.g. Over fitting, are addressed. This prevents a simple combination of classifiers of different classification approaches learned over different data sets. Many different methods of combining classification models have been proposed. However, most of them are based on a combination of the actual result of classification rather then producing a new, possibly more accurate, classifier capturing the combined classification information. In this paper we propose a new general approach to combining different classification models based on a concept of Decision Algebra which provides a unified formalization of classification approaches as higher order decision functions. It defines a general combining operation, referred to as merge operation, abstracting from implementation details of different classifiers. We show that the combination of a series of probably accurate decision functions (regardless of the actual implementation) is even more accurate. This can be exploited, e.g., For distributed learning and for efficient general online learning. We support our results by combining a series of decision graphs and Naive Bayesian classifiers learned from random samples of the data sets.

Tensor Regression Based on Linked Multiway Parameter Analysis,Yifan Fu (Charles Sturt University)Junbin Gao (Charles Sturt University)Xia Hong (University of Reading)David Tien (Charles Sturt University),"2149640560,2118078281,2473881814,2285340785","Classical regression methods take vectors as covariates and estimate the corresponding vectors of regression parameters. When addressing regression problems on covariates of more complex form such as multi-dimensional arrays (i.e. Tensors), traditional computational models can be severely compromised by ultrahigh dimensionality as well as complex structure. By exploiting the special structure of tensor covariates, the tensor regression model provides a promising solution to reduce the model's dimensionality to a manageable level, thus leading to efficient estimation. Most of the existing tensor-based methods independently estimate each individual regression problem based on tensor decomposition which allows the simultaneous projections of an input tensor to more than one direction along each mode. As a matter of fact, multi-dimensional data are collected under the same or very similar conditions, so that data share some common latent components but can also have their own independent parameters for each regression task. Therefore, it is beneficial to analyse regression parameters among all the regressions in a linked way. In this paper, we propose a tensor regression model based on Tucker Decomposition, which identifies not only the common components of parameters across all the regression tasks, but also independent factors contributing to each particular regression task simultaneously. Under this paradigm, the number of independent parameters along each mode is constrained by a sparsity-preserving regulariser. Linked multiway parameter analysis and sparsity modeling further reduce the total number of parameters, with lower memory cost than their tensor-based counterparts. The effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated on real data sets.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: tensor product networkmultilinear subspace learningpolynomial regressionneural codingdata modelingnickelstressregression analysiseconometricsmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics
Boosting for Vote Learning in High-Dimensional kNN Classification,Nenad Tomaev,2222817071,"Intrinsically high-dimensional data has recently been shown to exhibit substantial hubness in terms of skewness of the k-nearest neighbor occurrence frequency distribution. While some points arise as centers of influence and dominate most k-nearest neighbor sets, other points occur very rarely and barely affect the inferred models. Hubness has been shown to be highly detrimental to many learning tasks and several hubness-aware learning methods have recently been proposed. This paper extends the existing fuzzy neighbor occurrence models in order to enable cost-sensitive learning. We evaluate the extended implementations within the context of multi-class boosting, which is used to learn the appropriate neighbor votes during the re-weighting iterations. The proposed approach is evaluated on a series of high-dimensional datasets from various domains. The results demonstrate promising improvements of the proposed approach over the baselines.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingtraining setboostingcomputational modelmathematical modeldata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science

Abduction Dealing with Potential Values and Its Datasets,Akinori Abe (Chiba University),2193377564,"In this paper, we introduce the concept of ""value"" to the abduction procedure.

Outside of the main abduction procedure, the inference system can flexibly deal with ""values"" to generate hypotheses considering the user's preference, situation, and the current trends, etc. In addition, we introduce the concept of the expiration of the hypothesis in the hypothesis generation. Recently generated hypotheses are not generated during such abduction procedure, in addition. Accordingly, the system can generate rather novel hypotheses to enjoy potential chances.

K-MEAP: Generating Specified K Clusters with Multiple Exemplars by Efficient Affinity Propagation,Wang Yangtao (Nanyang Technological University)Chen Lihui (Nanyang Technological University),"2362757051,2149345534","Recently, an attractive clustering approach named multi-exemplar affinity propagation (MEAP) has been proposed as an extension to the single exemplar based Affinity Propagation (AP). MEAP is able to automatically identify multiple exemplars for each cluster associated with a super exemplar. However, if the cluster number is a prior knowledge and can be specified by the user, MEAP is unable to make use of such knowledge directly in its learning process. Instead it has to rely on re-running the process as many times as it takes by tuning parameters until it generates the desired number of clusters. The process of MEAP re-running may be very time consuming. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm called KMEAP which is able to generate specified K clusters directly while retaining the advantages of MEAP. Two kinds of new additional messages are introduced in MEAP in order to control the number of clusters in the process of message passing.

A New Fast Minimum Spanning Tree-Based Clustering Technique,Xiaochun Wang (Xi'an Jiaotong University)Xia Li WangJihua Zhu (Xi'an Jiaotong University),"2643808311,2692356047,2646841865","Due to its important applications in data mining, many techniques have been developed for clustering. For today's real-world databases which typically have millions of items with many thousands of fields, resulting in datasets that range in size into terabytes, many traditional clustering techniques have more and more restricted capabilities and novel approaches that are computationally efficient have become more and more popular. In this paper, a new efficient approach to graph-theoretical clustering using a minimum spanning tree representation of a dataset is proposed which consists of two-phases. In the first phase, we modify the standard Prim's algorithm in such a way that an efficient construction of such a tree can be realized based on k-nearest neighbor search mechanisms, during which a new edge weight is defined to maximize the intra-cluster similarity and minimize the inter-cluster similarity of the data set. In the second phase, based on the intuition that the data points are closer in the same cluster than in different clusters, the longest edges in the minimum spanning tree obtained from the first phase are removed to form clusters as the standard minimum spanning tree-based clustering algorithms do. Experiments on synthetic as well as real data sets have been conducted to show that our proposed approach works well with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: nearest neighbor chain algorithmk medians clusteringminimum spanning tree based segmentationcanopy clustering algorithmdistributed minimum spanning tree +19 others

Unfortunately, due to privacy concern or other reasons, the reporters sometimes may omit consciously some attributes, causing many missing values existing in the reporting database. Most of research work on ADR detection or methods applied in practice simply adopted list wise deletion to eliminate all data with missing values. Very little work has noticed the possibility and examined the effect of including the missing data in the process of ADR detection. This paper represents our endeavor towards the exploration of this question. We aim at inspecting the feasibility of applying rough set theory to the ADR detection problem. Based on the concept of utilizing characteristic set based approximation to measure the strength of ADR signals, we propose twelve different rough set based measuring methods and show only six of them are feasible for the purpose. Experimental results conducted on the FARES database show that our rough set based approach exhibits similar capability in timeline warning of suspicious ADR signals as traditional method with list wise deletion, and sometimes can yield noteworthy measures earlier than the traditional method.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: detection theoryset theoryaccuracy and precisioninformation systemdata science +5 others
Locating POS Terminals from Credit Card Transactions,Chao LiJia Chen (Huawei)Jun Luo,"2628844938,2424277594,2690196065","Credit card is a popular payment method and the transaction data keeps track of purchasing activities in people's daily lives. Extracting location of people's activities is an important task in many data mining problems because it may greatly help improve user experience and the service provided to people. Locating people from credit card transactions is equivalent to determining the location of every POS terminal where a payment takes place. This is however not an easy task because the locations of terminals are not usually provided to the credit card issuing companies and only a few terminals can be unambiguously located through map service by providing the merchants' names. In this paper, we propose a system to infer the locations of POS terminals using transaction data and map service. We first construct a transaction graph where the nodes are POS terminals. We then propose a two phase algorithm to find out uncertain and unknown locations of the terminals. In the first phase, we try to eliminate the uncertainty of POS terminals with multiple candidate locations. We show this problem is NP-hard and then give an effective heuristic algorithm to solve it. In the second phase, we compute the locations of unknown POS terminals by propagating the locations of known ones with spatial-temporal constraints. The algorithm is evaluated using a real-world credit card transaction data set and the result is promising for business applications.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: point of saleatm cardtrajectorylocationuncertainty +5 others

A Novel Disparity Refinement Method Based on Semi-Global Matching Algorithm,Yuechao Xie (Sun Yat-sen University)Siyu Zeng (Sun Yat-sen University)Long Chen (Sun Yat-sen University),"2222473214,2546925081,2692614670","Depth information can be obtained using stereo matching algorithms, which compute the horizontal displacement (disparity) of the corresponding points and convert to depth information using the triangular relation. However, the matching process is challenging with presence of textureless regions. This paper proposes a novel disparity refinement method for stereo matching based on Semi-global Matching (SGM) algorithm for texture less images. To be brief, the SGM algorithm is a high-performance matching algorithm of a stereo image pair and it reaches a trade off between matching quality and computing complexity. The main contribution comes from the improvement of matching quality on texture less regions. At the end of SGM, a right-to-left consistency check is performed to remove the invalid pixels in the disparity map. The proposed method is added after the right-to-left consistent check. We assume that the texture less regions in the original stereo pairs are planar. We employ edge detection to extract the textureless regions. The fitting method is employed in horizontal and vertical directions respectively. If the distance of two adjacent edge pixels is sufficiently large, the corresponding line segment will be considered as texturelss. For every texturelss line segment, the RANSAC algorithm is performed on the corresponding line segment in the disparity map. We use the well-known Middlebury dataset to compare our method with the normal SGM and other matching algorithms. It shows that our method performs well for most texture less stereo pairs.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: computer stereo visionradiometrytemplate matchingstereopsisimage segmentationrobustnesscomputer graphics imagescomputer visionpattern recognitioncomputer sciencemathematics

Dimensionality Reduction Based Similarity Visualization for Neural Gas,"Kadim Tasdemir (International University, Cambodia)",214236338,"Two commonly used neural networks for vector quantization based analysis of high-dimensional large datasets are the self-organizing map (SOM) and neural gas (NG). Owing to their rigid grid structure, SOMs are widely used for data visualization, whereas NG based visualization has been limited, despite the fact that NG can achieve better quantization than SOMs in terms of quantization error. As a visualization tool for NG, we propose to use a recent projection technique t-SNE (which depends on stochastic neighbor embedding using student t-distribution). T-SNE projection of NG will construct a low-dimensional space where local similarities of high-dimensional data space are preserved to a great extent. In addition, this enables the use of Connives (a topology-based visualization for SOMs) to represent the data space similarities on the low-dimensional projection space.

Whether using the variability of regular behaviour allows the creation of more consistent groupings of households is investigated and compared with daily load profile clustering. 204 UK households are analysed to find repeating patterns (motifs). Variability in the time of the motif is used as the basis for clustering households. Different clustering algorithms are assessed by the consistency of the results.

In this paper, we are presenting a model which deals with the limitations of previously existing POS Tagging algorithm, namely, Memory Based Learning Algorithm and Multi-Domain Web Based Algorithm. In Multi-Domain Web Based Algorithm, the unknown word is searched over the web for its possible tags which creates a runtime overhead (increases execution time), the tag with highest probability of occurrence is assigned to the word. The process repeats itself every time the algorithm runs, even for the words previously been searched. Whereas, Memory Based Learning Algorithm is a lazy learning algorithm. In this algorithm, the word is first searched in the lexicon, if the word is found, its lexical representation is retrieved, but, if it is not found, its lexical representation is computed with the help of similarity metrics.

Generalized fuzzy c-means with spatial information for clustering of remote sensing images,Prem Shankar Singh Aydav (Jawaharlal Nehru University)Sonajharia Minz (Jawaharlal Nehru University),"1086779805,2031755020",Fuzzy c-means clustering technique has been popularly used for remote sensing image data classification. However as per the studies the classical fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm has been able to achieve less accuracy due to spatial relationship existence and multi class existence in remotely sensed images. Remote sensing images contain large number of classes but the probability of a pixel belonging to some classes may be low. Traditional fuzzy c-means algorithm considers all classes simultaneously during clustering process. In this paper generalized fuzzy c-means has been applied in exploring k nearest neighbors approach out of c cluster centers. Spatial information has been also integrated with generalized fuzzy c-means technique. The experimental results show that the generalized fuzzy c-means technique with spatial information yields better results than traditional fuzzy c-means technique.,2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: flame clusteringcorrelation clusteringfuzzy clusteringcluster analysisdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics

ModBoost for unbiased classification,Karan Shah (Information Technology University)Sapna Gala (Information Technology University)Nahush Patil (Information Technology University),"2096820214,2231159302,2229671584","Many real world data mining applications involve learning from large data sets. Boosting, an ensemble-based learning algorithm, has shown to improve the performance of classifiers in many situations. In this paper, we describe a new approach that is a modified version of boosting. In the ModBoost method, the sample training set is produced from the given dataset by sampling with replacement. The model is generated from the sample training set and is evaluated for error on the dataset instead of the training set. Misclassified tuples are given a higher weight and subsequently, in the next iterations the misclassified tuples are given first preferences and resampling is done for the rest of the training set. The total weights of the different classes in the new training set are rebalanced. The ModBoost method is evaluated, in terms of the F-measures, Precision, Recall and overall accuracy against large and moderately imbalanced bank marketing data set using Naive Bayesian as a base classifier. The results are promising and show that the ModBoost method compares well in comparison with AdaBoost and bagging algorithm.

Reddy (Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University),"2714816151,2222023475","Clustering of nodes is one of the basic techniques used for data collection in wireless sensor networks. It has been observed that in most of these clustering techniques based upon the local attributes of sensor nodes, some of them are selected as cluster-heads. The nodes which are selected as cluster-head have to dissipate more energy as they have to receive and aggregate data of their respective member nodes. Moreover, Cluster-head nodes near to sink dissipate more energy as these nodes have to relay data of far off placed nodes. Due to this fast dissipation of energy, energy holes are created near to sink which in turn decreases network lifetime. In order to address these issues, we present energy efficient clustering method and propose to select sink as one of the cluster-heads. By selecting sink as cluster-head, the nodes placed near to it can be spared from performing duties of cluster-heads and thus the problem of energy hole creation near to sink can be avoided. The proposed method has been named as energy efficient clustering with sink as cluster-head - EEC-SCH. We compare EEC-SCH with LEACH-ERE, LEACH and WCA. Our simulation results show that EEC-SCH results into enhanced network lifetime, throughput and balanced energy consumption among sensor nodes.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: key distribution in wireless sensor networksmobile wireless sensor networkwireless sensor networkefficient energy usetelecommunicationscomputer securitycomputer networkcomputer science

To remove such spectral confusion one requires extra spectral and spatial knowledge.

The attribute suffering missing entries in a deficient database is recast as a decision attribute in another reference database. The tenets of RS theory are then applied to derive rules that predict the missing values.

Therefore, it is worthwhile to carefully estimate the reliability of the system. We know many times in real life situations, it is difficult to obtain the complete and clear information for a complicated system so decisions for the system are made on the state of uncertainty. To handle these types of situations the concept of fuzzy theory was introduced. But there are instances where fuzzy information can also show uncertainty which can be dealt with the concept of conflicting bifuzzy sets.

A Method For Evaluating An Action Rule Specified By A User,Seunghyun Im (University of Pittsburgh),2151301588,"An action rule is a rule extracted from a decision table that describes the expected change in the decision value of an object as a result of the changes made to some of its condition values.

Various methods have been proposed to automatically generate concise and effective action rules. However, a practical problem not discussed in the existing literature is the method for evaluating an action rule specified by a user. This is an important task because, in many cases, users (e.g. the decision maker of an organization) have some knowledge about specific actions they can take, and need to know the performance of the action rule to make a better decision.

Estimating Tea Stock Values Using Cluster Analysis,Amitha Caldera (University of Colombo)Dilini T. R. Serasinghe Sajitha N. Kaluarachchi,"2126890184,2082791735","Asia Siyaka is a leading tea broker which has about 15% market share and annually sells tea with the worth of about 18 billion rupees. Tea brokers auction tea on behalf of the factory owners. Many factories buy tea from non-factory holding growers but it takes time for green leaves to become cash at the auction. Hence factories borrow money from the brokers on behalf of future stock to be auctioned to ensure seamless cash flow. The brokers’ main challenge is to estimate the stock which will be sold in the future auctions before granting advances. The current system uses previous month’s realized auction average prices of each factory to estimate the each factory’s stock. This method is incorrect due to the variation of the grade mix of factory wise production and the price variation of tea grades with time without any pattern. Therefore requirement exists to discover an accurate method to estimate the tea stock. This paper used initial descriptive statistics which helped to understand the data and the current system. The paper also used more explorative approach because of the complexity of the problem and unclearness about the relationship of the data. Therefore cluster analysis, which is an unsupervised learning technique, was selected. The analysis shows that comparison should be done with the most recent auction data and also shows that factory, grade and package weight are the only visible attributes which can contribute to future stock value calculations.",2014,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: wirelessinformationdata miningcomputer science

Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms Based on Filipino-Vietnamese Speeches,Hoa T. Le,2111877007,"People of different races are characterized by the language they speak. They can identify voices of someone’s race just by listening and talking through conversation. This paper presents an efficient comparison of machine learning algorithm based on Filipino-Vietnamese speeches for tone classification using feature parameter. The system was trained using audio recorded speeches samples. Datasets were taken from multiple sessions involving 10 respondents; 5 (five) of which are Filipinos and 5 (five) Vietnamese. The respondents were asked to read the paragraphs and record their voices while reading the data. The empirical test shows that during the pre-processing of data records, Vietnamese have longer range of duration as compared to Filipinos because of their manners in reading and intensity on accent-bearing syllables. In constructing the speech recognition model, four classification algorithms were used, namely: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour), Naive-Bayes, SMO (Support Vector Machine) and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). The evaluation of the training set in terms of accuracy, correctly classified instances and incorrectly classified instances are evaluated by the performance of the developed system. As the data established, the results show that SMO and MLP performed better for all the given datasets, with accuracy rates ranging from 99.2694% for MLP and 98.7179% for SMO.

When detecting communities, there are two possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the features and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes that have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only focused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms mostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Communities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node attributes. CESNA statistically models the interaction between the network structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community detection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the network structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able to process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches.

How to leverage Twitter for early detection of bursty topics has therefore become an important research problem with immense practical value. Despite the wealth of research work on topic modeling and analysis in Twitter, it remains a huge challenge to detect bursty topics in real-time. As existing methods can hardly scale to handle the task with the tweet stream in real-time, we propose in this paper Topic Sketch, a novel sketch-based topic model together with a set of techniques to achieve real-time detection. We evaluate our solution on a tweet stream with over 30 million tweets. Our experiment results show both efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

Enumeration of Time Series Motifs of All Lengths,Abdullah Mueen (University of New Mexico),2083987245,"Time series motifs are repeated patterns in long and noisy time series. Motifs are typically used to understand the dynamics of the source because repeated patterns with high similarity evidentially rule out the presence of noise. Recently, time series motifs have also been used for clustering, summarization, rule discovery and compression as features. For all such purposes, many high quality motifs of various lengths are desirable and thus, originates the problem of enumerating motifs for a wide range of lengths. Existing algorithms find motifs for a given length. A trivial way to enumerate motifs is to run one of the algorithms for the whole range of lengths. However, such parameter sweep is computationally infeasible for large real datasets. In this paper, we describe an exact algorithm, called MOEN, to enumerate motifs. The algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than the naive algorithm. The algorithm frees us from re-discovering the same motif at different lengths and tuning multiple data-dependent parameters. The speedup comes from using a novel bound on the similarity function across lengths and the algorithm uses only linear space unlike other motif discovery algorithms. We describe three case studies in entomology and activity recognition where MOEN enumerates several high quality motifs.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: correlationtime seriesupper and lower boundsdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticsmathematics

However, since most transaction systems are only designated for billing purpose, typically, fine-grained location information, such as the exact boarding and alighting stops of a bus trip, is only partially or not available at all, which blocks deep exploitation of this rich and valuable data at individual level. This paper presents a ""space alignment"" framework to reconstruct individual mobility history from a large-scale smart card transaction dataset pertaining to a metropolitan city. Specifically, we show that by delicately aligning the monetary space and geospatial space with the temporal space, we are able to extrapolate a series of critical domain specific constraints. Later, these constraints are naturally incorporated into a semi-supervised conditional random field to infer the exact boarding and alighting stops of all transit routes with a surprisingly high accuracy, e.g., given only 10% trips with known alighting/boarding stops, we successfully inferred more than 78% alighting and boarding stops from all unlabeled trips. In addition, we demonstrated that the smart card data enriched by the proposed approach dramatically improved the performance of a conventional method for identifying users' home and work places (with 88% improvement on home detection and 35% improvement on work place detection). The proposed method offers the possibility to mine individual mobility from common public transit transactions, and showcases how uncertain data can be leveraged with domain knowledge and constraints, to support cross-application data mining tasks.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: smart cardlabeling theorygeospatial analysiscomputer securitydata miningsimulationcomputer science

The simple greedy algorithm [14] achieves an approximation ratio of 1-1/e. The advanced CELF algorithm [16], by exploiting the sub modular property of the spread function, runs 700 times faster than the simple greedy algorithm on average. However, CELF is still inefficient [4], as the first iteration calls for N times of spread estimations (N is the number of nodes in networks), which is computationally expensive especially for large networks. To this end, in this paper we derive an upper bound function for the spread function. The bound can be used to reduce the number of Monte-Carlo simulation calls in greedy algorithms, especially in the first iteration of initialization. Based on the upper bound, we propose an efficient Upper Bound based Lazy Forward algorithm (UBLF in short), by incorporating the bound into the CELF algorithm.

Prediction social links for new users is very important. Different from conventional link prediction problems, link prediction for new users is more challenging due to the lack of information from the new users in the network. Meanwhile, in recent years, users are usually involved in multiple social networks simultaneously to enjoy the specific services offered by different social networks. The shared users of multiple networks can act as the ""anchors"" aligned the networks they participate in. In this paper, we propose a link prediction method called SCAN-PS (Supervised Cross Aligned Networks link prediction with Personalized Sampling), to solve the social link prediction problem for new users. SCAN-PS can use information transferred from both the existing active users in the target network and other source networks through aligned accounts.

In this paper, we develop a framework to predict mobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding the current device status of a smartphone. Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial prerequisite for fast App launching, intelligent user experience, and power management of smartphones. By analyzing real App usage log data, we discover two kinds of features: The Explicit Feature (EF) from sensing readings of built-in sensors, and the Implicit Feature (IF) from App usage relations. The IF feature is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph (abbreviated as AUG) that models App usage transitions. In light of AUG, we are able to discover usage relations among Apps. Since users may have different usage behaviors on their smartphones, we further propose one personalized feature selection algorithm. We explore minimum description length (MDL) from the training data and select those features which need less length to describe the training data. The personalized feature selection can successfully reduce the log size and the prediction time. Finally, we adopt the kNN classification model to predict Apps usage. Note that through the features selected by the proposed personalized feature selection algorithm, we only need to keep these features, which in turn reduces the prediction time and avoids the curse of dimensionality when using the kNN classifier. The results based on a real dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the predictive capability for App usage prediction.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: biological classificationfeature selectionmobile computinggraph theoryworld wide webdata miningmachine learningcomputer science

Compared to the classic frequent sequence mining, the utility framework provides more informative and actionable knowledge since the utility of a sequence indicates business value and impact. However, the introduction of ""utility"" makes the problem fundamentally different from the frequency-based pattern mining framework and brings about dramatic challenges. Although the existing high utility sequential pattern mining algorithms can discover all the patterns satisfying a given minimum utility, it is often difficult for users to set a proper minimum utility. A too small value may produce thousands of patterns, whereas a too big one may lead to no findings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called top-k high utility sequential pattern mining to tackle this critical problem. Accordingly, an efficient algorithm, Top-k high Utility Sequence (TUS for short) mining, is designed to identify top-k high utility sequential patterns without minimum utility. In addition, three effective features are introduced to handle the efficiency problem, including two strategies for raising the threshold and one pruning for filtering unpromising items. Our experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real datasets. The results show that TUS incorporating the efficiency-enhanced strategies demonstrates impressive performance without missing any high utility sequential patterns.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: sequencesortingutilityalgorithm designdata sciencedata miningmachine learningcomputer science

This question has been asked many times in sociology, psychology and computer science, and a whole plethora of centrality measures (a.k.a. centrality indices, or rankings) were proposed to account for the importance of the nodes of a network. In this paper, we approach the problem of computing geometric centralities, such as closeness [1] and harmonic centrality [2], on very large graphs; traditionally this task requires an all-pairs shortest-path computation in the exact case, or a number of breadth-first traversals for approximated computations, but these techniques yield very weak statistical guarantees on highly disconnected graphs. We rather assume that the graph is accessed in a semi-streaming fashion, that is, that adjacency lists are scanned almost sequentially, and that a very small amount of memory (in the order of a dozen bytes) per node is available in core memory. We leverage the newly discovered algorithms based on HyperLogLog counters [3], making it possible to approximate a number of geometric centralities at a very high speed and with high accuracy. While the application of similar algorithms for the approximation of closeness was attempted in the MapReduce [4] framework [5], our exploitation of HyperLogLog counters reduces exponentially the memory footprint, paving the way for in-core processing of networks with a hundred billion nodes using ""just"" 2TiB of RAM.

In this paper, using two real-world transportation datasets: 1) incident data and 2) traffic data, we address the problem of predicting and quantifying the impact of traffic incidents. Traffic incidents include any non-recurring events on road networks, including accidents, weather hazard, road construction or work zone closures. By analyzing archived incident data, we classify incidents based on their features (e.g., time, location, type of incident). Subsequently, we model the impact of each incident class on its surrounding traffic by analyzing the archived traffic data at the time and location of the incidents. Consequently, in real-time, if we observe a similar incident (from real-time incident data), we can predict and quantify its impact on the surrounding traffic using our developed models. This information, in turn, can help drivers to effectively avoid impacted areas in real-time. To be useful for such real-time navigation application, and unlike current approaches, we study the dynamic behavior of incidents and model the impact as a quantitative time varying spatial span. In addition to utilizing incident features, we improve our classification approach further by analyzing traffic density around the incident area and the initial behavior of the incident. We evaluated our approach with very large traffic and incident datasets collected from the road networks of Los Angeles County and the results show that we can improve our baseline approach, which solely relies on incident features, by up to 45%.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: intelligent transportation systemtransportnavigationtime seriesdata analysiscomputer securitysimulationstatisticscomputer science

Although realistic informatics graphs often do not have meaningful tree-like structure when viewed with respect to the simplest and most popular metrics, e.g., the value of d or the tree width, we conclude that many such graphs do have meaningful tree-like structure when viewed with respect to more refined metrics, e.g., a size-resolved notion of d or a closer analysis of the tree decompositions. We also show that, although these two rigorous notions of tree-likeness capture very different tree-like structures in worst-case, for realistic informatics graphs they empirically identify surprisingly similar structure.

Modeling Temporal Adoptions Using Dynamic Matrix Factorization,Freddy Chong Tat ChuaRichard Jayadi OentaryoEe-Peng Lim (Singapore Management University),"2645131342,2628825660,2130308643","The problem of recommending items to users is relevant to many applications and the problem has often been solved using methods developed from Collaborative Filtering (CF).

In this paper, we adopted a Dynamic Matrix Factorization (DMF) technique to derive different temporal factorization models that can predict missing adoptions at different time steps in the users' adoption history.

Many efforts have been done to generate concise yet semantic representation, such as bag-of-words, phrase, sentence and topic-level descriptions. Nevertheless, most existing techniques counter difficulties in handling monolingual comparable corpus, which is a collection of monolingual documents conveying the same topic. In this paper, we propose the use of frame, a high-level semantic unit, and construct frame-based representations to semantically describe documents by bags of frames, using an information network approach. One major challenge in this representation is that semantically similar frames may be of different forms. For example, ""radiation leaked"" in one news article can appear as ""the level of radiation increased"" in another article. To tackle the problem, a text-based information network is constructed among frames and words, and a link-based similarity measure called SynRank is proposed to calculate similarity between frames. As a result, different variations of the semantically similar frames are merged into a single descriptive frame using clustering, and a document can then be represented as a bag of representative frames. It turns out that frame-based document representation not only is more interpretable, but also can facilitate other text analysis tasks such as event tracking effectively. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments on three comparable news corpora, to study the effectiveness of frame-based document representation and the similarity measure SynRank, respectively, and demonstrate that the superior performance of frame-based document representation on different real-world applications.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: semantic similaritylabeling theorycluster analysissemanticstext miningnatural language processinginformation retrievaldata miningcomputer science

Providing such a prediction early and accurately allows for designing a more successful treatment that starts before a disease completely develops. Information for this kind of early diagnosis could be extracted by use of temporal data mining methods for handling complex multivariate time series. However, physicians usually prefer to use interpretable models that can be easily explained, rather than relying on more complex black-box approaches. In this study, a temporal data mining method is proposed for extracting interpretable patterns from multivariate time series data, which can be used to assist in providing interpretable early diagnosis. The problem is formulated as an optimization based binary classification task addressed in three steps. First, the time series data is transformed into a binary matrix representation suitable for application of classification methods. Second, a novel convex-concave optimization problem is defined to extract multivariate patterns from the constructed binary matrix. Then, a mixed integer discrete optimization formulation is provided to reduce the dimensionality and extract interpretable multivariate patterns.

To date, blocking methods have required the blocking scheme be given, or the provision of training data enabling supervised learning algorithms to determine a blocking scheme. In either case, a domain expert is required. This paper develops an unsupervised method for learning a blocking scheme for tabular data sets. The method is divided into two phases. First, a weakly labeled training set is generated automatically in time linear in the number of records of the entire dataset.

Causal relationships can be identified with controlled experiments, but such experiments are often very expensive and sometimes impossible to conduct.

Significant progress has been made in the field of discovering causal relationships using the Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) theory. The applications of CBNs, however, are greatly limited due to the high computational complexity. In another direction, association rule mining has been shown to be an efficient data mining means for relationship discovery. However, although causal relationships imply associations, the reverse does not always hold. In this paper we study how to use an efficient association mining approach to discover potential causal rules in observational data.

For instance, users' profiles can be used to group users for recommendation systems. In addition, a model can also use users' historical behaviors and credit history to group users. Each dataset contains different information and suffices for learning. A number of clustering algorithms on multiple datasets were proposed during the past few years. These algorithms assume that at least one dataset is complete. So far as we know, all the previous methods will not be applicable if there is no complete dataset available. However, in reality, there are many situations where no dataset is complete. As in building a recommendation system, some new users may not have profiles or historical behaviors, while some may not have credit history. Hence, no available dataset is complete. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach called Collective Kernel Learning to infer hidden sample similarity from multiple incomplete datasets. The idea is to collectively completes the kernel matrices of incomplete datasets by optimizing the alignment of shared instances of the datasets.

These models are ideal for prediction in complex data problems where the response is a time-to-event variable. An event is defined as the occurrence of a specific event of interest such as a chronic health condition. Cox regression is one of the most popular survival regression model used in such applications. However, these models have the tendency to over fit the data which is not desirable for healthcare applications because it limits their generalization to other hospital scenarios. In this paper, we address these challenges for the cox regression model. We combine two unique correlation based regularizers with cox regression to handle correlated and grouped features which are commonly seen in many practical problems. The proposed optimization problems are solved efficiently using cyclic coordinate descent and Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers algorithms.

The proposed algorithm discovers these latent features by constructing label propagation matrices in the source and target networks, and mapping them into a shared latent feature space. The latent features capture common structure patterns shared by two networks, and serve as domain-independent features to be transferred between networks.

Multitask Learning with Feature Selection for Groups of Related Tasks,Meenakshi Mishra (University of Kansas)Jun Huan (University of Kansas),"2192999366,2139058963","Multitask learning has been thoroughly proven to improve the generalization performance given a set of related tasks. Most multitask learning algorithm assume that all tasks are related. However, if all the tasks are not related, negative transfer of information occurs amongst the tasks, and the performance of traditional multitask learning algorithm worsens. Thus, we design an algorithm that simultaneously groups the related tasks and trains only the related task together. There are different approaches to train the related tasks in multi-task learning based on which information is shared across the tasks. These approaches either assume that the parameters of each of the tasks are situated close together, or assume that there is a common underlying latent space in the features of the tasks that is related. Most multi-task learning algorithm use either regularization method or matrix-variate priors. In our algorithm, the related tasks are tied together by a set of common features selected by each tasks. Thus, to train the related tasks together, we use spike and slab prior to select a common set of features for the related tasks, and a mixture of gaussians prior to select the set of related tasks. For validation, the developed algorithm is tested on toxicity prediction and hand written digit recognition data sets. The results show a significant improvement over multitask learning with feature selection for larger number of tasks.

User behavior is inherently sensitive to various contexts. Identifying such relevant contexts can help to improve the prediction performance. In this work, we propose a formal approach in which the context discovery process is defined as an optimization problem. For simplicity we assume a concrete yet generic scenario in which context is considered to be a secondary label of an instance that is either known from the available contextual attribute (e.g. user location) or can be induced from the training data (e.g. novice vs. expert user). In an ideal case, the objective function of the optimization problem has an analytical form enabling us to design a context discovery algorithm solving the optimization problem directly. An example with Markov models, a typical approach for modeling user browsing behavior, shows that the derived analytical form of the optimization problem provides us with useful mathematical insights of the problem. Experiments with a real-world use-case show that we can discover useful contexts allowing us to significantly improve the prediction of user intentions with contextual Markov models.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: information systemmarkov processknowledge managementdata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Network Hypothesis Testing Using Mixed Kronecker Product Graph Models,Sebastian Moreno (Purdue University)Jennifer Neville (Purdue University),"2104332529,2124572662","The recent interest in networks-social, physical, communication, information, etc.-has fueled a great deal of research on the analysis and modeling of graphs. However, many of the analyses have focused on a single large network (e.g., a sub network sampled from Facebook). Although several studies have compared networks from different domains or samples, they largely focus on empirical exploration of network similarities rather than explicit tests of hypotheses. This is in part due to a lack of statistical methods to determine whether two large networks are likely to have been drawn from the same underlying graph distribution. Research on across-network hypothesis testing methods has been limited by (i) difficulties associated with obtaining a set of networks to reason about the underlying graph distribution, and (ii) limitations of current statistical models of graphs that make it difficult to represent variations across networks.

However, the increasing prevalence of inexpensive sensors has reinforced the need for algorithms to handle multi-dimensional time series. For example, modern smartphones have at least a dozen sensors capable of producing streaming time series, and hospital-based (and increasingly, home-based) medical devices can produce time series streams from more than twenty sensors. The two most common ways to generalize from single to multi-dimensional data are to use all the streams or just the single best stream as determined at training time. However, as we show here, both approaches can be very brittle. Moreover, neither approach exploits the observation that different sensors may be considered ""experts"" on different classes. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for multi-dimensional time series classification that weights the class prediction from each time series stream. These weights are based not only on each stream's previous track record on the class it is currently predicting, but also on the distance from the unlabeled object. As we demonstrate with extensive experiments on real data, our method is more accurate than current approaches and particularly robust in the face of concept drift or sensor noise.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: time seriesdata sciencedata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

It proposes a novel, generic approach for handling pattern mining problems that involve pair wise comparisons between patterns. Our key contributions are the following. First, we propose a novel algebra for programming pattern mining problems. This algebra extends relational algebras in a novel way towards pattern mining. It allows for the generic combination of constraints on individual patterns with dominance relations between patterns.

However, DBSCAN requires specifying all pair wise (dis)similarities among objects that can be non-trivial to obtain in many applications. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel active density-based clustering algorithm, named Act-DBSCAN, which works under a restricted number of used pair wise similarities. Act-DBSCAN exploits the pair wise lower-bounding (LB) similarities to initialize the cluster structure. Then, it adaptively selects the most informative pair wise LB similarities to update with the real ones in order to reconstruct the result until the budget limitation is reached. The goal is to approximate as much as possible the true clustering result with each update. Our Act-DBSCAN framework is built upon a proposed probabilistic model to score the impact of the update of each pair wise LB similarity on the change of the intermediate clustering structure. Deriving from this scoring system and the monotonicity and reduction property of our active clustering process, we propose the two efficient algorithms to iteratively select and update pair wise similarities and cluster structure. Experiments on real datasets show that Act-DBSCAN acquires good clustering results with only a few pair wise similarities, and requires only a small fraction of all pair wise similarities to reach the DBSCAN results. Act-DBSCAN also outperforms other related techniques such as active spectral clustering.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: k medians clusteringsubclucanopy clustering algorithmoptics algorithmdbscancorrelation clusteringconstrained clusteringdata stream clusteringsingle linkage clusteringfuzzy clusteringactive learningclustering high dimensional datakernelprobabilistic logiccluster analysisnoiseestimationprobabilitydata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticsmathematics

Previous studies focused on binary-class imbalance problem, whereas multi-class imbalance problem is more challenging. Error correcting output codes (ECOC) technique can be applied to class-imbalance problem, however, the standard ECOC aims at maximizing accuracy, ignoring the fact that, when class-imbalance is really a problem, the minority classes are more important than the majority classes. To enable ECOC to tackle multi-class imbalance, it is desired to have an appropriate code matrix, an effective learning strategy and a decoding strategy emphasizing the minority classes. In this paper, based on the aforementioned consideration, we propose the imECOC method which works on dichotomies to handle both the between-class imbalance and within-class imbalance. As the dichotomy classifiers contribute differently to the final prediction, imECOC assigns weights to dichotomies and uses weighted distance for decoding, where the optimal dichotomy weights are obtained by minimizing a weighted loss in favor of the minority classes.

Active Query Driven by Uncertainty and Diversity for Incremental Multi-label Learning,Sheng-Jun Huang (Nanjing University)Zhi-Hua Zhou (Nanjing University),"2145988500,2286237009","In multi-label learning, it is rather expensive to label instances since they are simultaneously associated with multiple labels. Therefore, active learning, which reduces the labeling cost by actively querying the labels of the most valuable data, becomes particularly important for multi-label learning. A strong multi-label active learning algorithm usually consists of two crucial elements: a reasonable criterion to evaluate the gain of queried label, and an effective classification model, based on whose prediction the criterion can be accurately computed. In this paper, we first introduce an effective multi-label classification model by combining label ranking with threshold learning, which is incrementally trained to avoid retraining from scratch after every query. Based on this model, we then propose to exploit both uncertainty and diversity in the instance space as well as the label space, and actively query the instance-label pairs which can improve the classification model most.

Hence, it is important to select congruent subspaces (i.e., subsets of the node attributes) showing dependencies with the graph structure.

However, current research on prediction combination focuses on the single label setting, where an instance can have one and only one label. Nonetheless, data nowadays are usually multilabeled, such that more than one label have to be predicted at the same time. Direct applications of existing prediction combination methods to multilabel settings can lead to degenerated performance. In this paper, we address the challenges of combining predictions from multiple multilabel classifiers and propose two novel algorithms, MLCM-r (MultiLabel Consensus Maximization for ranking) and MLCM-a (MLCM for microAUC). These algorithms can capture label correlations that are common in multilabel classifications, and optimize corresponding performance metrics. Experimental results on popular multilabel classification tasks verify the theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed methods.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: ensemblbig datadata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science
On Estimation of Functional Causal Models: Post-Nonlinear Causal Model as an Example,Kun Zhang (Max Planck Society)Zhikun Wang (Max Planck Society)Bernhard Scholkopf (Max Planck Society),"2151570909,2614376947,297432538","Compared to constraint-based causal discovery, causal discovery based on functional causal models is able to identify the whole causal model under appropriate assumptions. Functional causal models represent the effect as a function of the direct causes together with an independent noise term. Examples include the linear non-Gaussian a cyclic model (LiNGAM), nonlinear additive noise model, and post-nonlinear (PNL) model. Currently there are two ways to estimate the parameters in the models, one is by dependence minimization, and the other is maximum likelihood. In this paper, we show that for any a cyclic functional causal model, minimizing the mutual information between the hypothetical cause and the noise term is equivalent to maximizing the data likelihood with a flexible model for the distribution of the noise term. We then focus on estimation of the PNL causal model, and propose to estimate it with the warped Gaussian process with the noise modeled by the mixture of Gaussians. As a Bayesian nonparametric approach, it outperforms the previous one based on mutual information minimization with nonlinear functions represented by multilayer perceptrons, we also show that unlike the ordinary regression, estimation results of the PNL causal model are sensitive to the assumption on the noise distribution. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical claims.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: causal systemmaximum likelihoodeconometricspattern recognitionstatisticsmathematics

These are not practical assumptions: trajectories are often noisy, and there can be a paucity of examples. Our novel approach incorporates advice-giving into the IRL framework to address these issues. Inspired by preference elicitation, a domain expert provides advice on states and actions (features) by stating preferences over them.

This process pretends to group objects based in their spatial and temporal similarity helping to discover interesting patterns and correlations in large data sets. One of the main challenges of this area is the ability to integrate several dimensions in a general-purpose approach. In this paper, such general approach is proposed, based on an extension of the SNN (Shared Nearest Neighbor) algorithm. The 4D+SNN algorithm allows the integration of space, time and one or more semantic attributes in the clustering process. This algorithm is able to deal with different data sets and different discovery purposes as the user has the ability to weight the importance of each dimension in the discovery process.

Interest Analysis Using Semantic PageRank and Social Interaction Content,Chung-Chi HuangLun-Wei Ku (Academia Sinica),"2713785192,2108479962","Social media has long been a popular resource for sentiment analysis and data mining. In this paper, we learn to predict reader interest after article reading using social interaction content in social media. The abundant interaction content (e.g., reader feedback) aims to replace typically private reader profile and browse history. Our method involves estimating interest preferences with respect to article topics and identifying quality social content concerning informativity. During interest analysis, we combine and transform articles and their reader responses into PageRank word graph to balance author- and reader-end influence. Semantic features of words, such as their content sources (authors vs. readers), syntactic parts-of-speech, and degrees of references (i.e., significances) among authors and readers, are used to weight PageRank word graph. We present the prototype system, Interest Finder, that applies the method to reader interest prediction by calculating word interestingness scores. Two sets of evaluation show that traditional, local Page Rank can more accurately cover more span of reader interest with the help of topical interest preferences learned globally, word nodes' semantic information, and, most important of all, quality social interaction content such as reader feedback.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: social mediamultimediaworld wide webinformation retrievaldata miningcomputer science
Conformal Prediction Using Decision Trees,Ulf Johansson (IT University)Henrik Bostrom (Stockholm University)Tuve Lofstrom (IT University),"2617570531,2082592554,2599888053","Conformal prediction is a relatively new framework in which the predictive models output sets of predictions with a bound on the error rate, i.e., in a classification context, the probability of excluding the correct class label is lower than a predefined significance level. An investigation of the use of decision trees within the conformal prediction framework is presented, with the overall purpose to determine the effect of different algorithmic choices, including split criterion, pruning scheme and way to calculate the probability estimates. Since the error rate is bounded by the framework, the most important property of conformal predictors is efficiency, which concerns minimizing the number of elements in the output prediction sets. Results from one of the largest empirical investigations to date within the conformal prediction framework are presented, showing that in order to optimize efficiency, the decision trees should be induced using no pruning and with smoothed probability estimates. The choice of split criterion to use for the actual induction of the trees did not turn out to have any major impact on the efficiency. Finally, the experimentation also showed that when using decision trees, standard inductive conformal prediction was as efficient as the recently suggested method cross-conformal prediction. This is an encouraging results since cross-conformal prediction uses several decision trees, thus sacrificing the interpretability of a single decision tree.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: conformal mapdecision treeaccuracy and precisioncalibrationpredictive modellinginformation systempredictionprobabilitydata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

When the membership of an individual in a class cannot be established deterministically, this monitoring activity requires classification. However, in the above applications the final goal is not determining which class each individual belongs to, but simply estimating the prevalence of each class in the unlabeled data. This task is called quantification. In a supervised learning framework we may estimate the distribution across the classes in a test set from a training set of labeled individuals. However, this may be sub optimal, since the distribution in the test set may be substantially different from that in the training set (a phenomenon called distribution drift). So far, quantification has mostly been addressed by learning a classifier optimized for individual classification and later adjusting the distribution it computes to compensate for its tendency to either under-or over-estimate the prevalence of the class. In this paper we propose instead to use a type of decision trees (quantification trees) optimized not for individual classification, but directly for quantification.

Mining User Lifecycles from Online Community Platforms and their Application to Churn Prediction,Matthew Rowe (Lancaster University),2290134306,"Recent work has studied user development in the domains of both telecommunication and online community platforms, examining how users develop in terms of the company they keep (socially) and the language they use (lexically). Such works afford key insights into user changes along individual dimensions, yet they do not examine how users develop relative to their prior behaviour along multiple dimensions. In this paper we examine how users develop along various properties (in-degree, out-degree, posted terms) in three online community platforms (Facebook, SAP Community Network, and Server Fault) and using three models of user development: (i) isolated lifecycle periods, (ii) historical contrasts, and (iii) community contrasts. We present an approach to mine the lifecycle trajectories of users as a means to characterise user development along the different properties and development models, and demonstrate the utility of such trajectories in predicting churners. We find consistent effects with past work: users tend to reflect the behaviour of the community in early portions of their lifecycles, before then diverging from the community towards the end.

As such, the last decade has seen extensive research efforts in motif discovery algorithms for text, DNA, time series, protein sequences, graphs, images, and video. Surprisingly, there has been less attention devoted to finding repeated patterns in audio sequences, in spite of their ubiquity in science and entertainment. While there is significant work for the special case of motifs in music, virtually all this work makes many assumptions about data (often to the point of being genre specific) and thus these algorithms do not generalize to audio sequences containing animal vocalizations, industrial processes, or a host of other domains that we may wish to explore.

These dynamic patterns require a new approach to define and optimize penalized likelihood ratio statistics in the subset scan framework, as well as new computational techniques that scale to large, real-world networks.

Second, our Additive Graph Scan algorithm allows our novel scan statistic to process small graphs (500 nodes) in 4.1 seconds on average while maintaining an approximation ratio over 99% compared to an exact optimization method, and to scale to large graphs with over 12,000 nodes in 30 minutes on average.

This may in turn open the door to concrete applications, such as finding influential users for a topic in a social network, or detecting the typical structure of a web browsing session that leads to a product purchase. In this paper we define the problem of mining summaries of propagations as a constrained pattern-mining problem. A propagation is a DAG where an entity (e.g., information exchanged in a social network, or a user browsing a website) flows following the underlying hierarchical structure of the nodes. A summary is a set of propagations that (i) involve a similar population of nodes, and (ii) exhibit a coherent hierarchical structure when merged altogether to form a single graph. The first constraint is defined based on the Jaccard coefficient, while the definition of the second one relies on the graph-theoretic concept of ""agony"" of a graph. It turns out that both constraints satisfy the downward closure property, thus enabling Apriori-like algorithms. However, motivated by the fact that computing agony is much more expensive than computing Jaccard, we devise two algorithms that explore the search space differently. The first algorithm is an Apriori-like, bottom-up method that checks both the constraints level-by-level. The second algorithm consists of a first phase where the search space is pruned as much as possible by exploiting the Jaccard constraint only, while involving the second constraint only afterwards, in a subsequent phase. We test our algorithms on four real-world datasets. Quantitative results reveal that the choice of the most efficient algorithm depends on the selectivity of the two constraints. Qualitative results show the relevance of the extracted summaries in a number of real-world scenarios.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: a priori and a posterioridirected graphgraphlatticesocial networkdata sciencedata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Recently, the importance of frequent graph patterns has been recognized in the various works on graph mining, but unfortunately this crucial criterion has not been noticed in the existing graph generators. To address this important need, we make the first attempt to design a Pattern Preserving Graph Generation (PPGG) algorithm to generate a graph including all frequent patterns and three most popular statistical parameters: degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and average vertex degree. The experimental results show that PPGG, which we have released as a free download, is efficient and able to generate a billion-node graph in approximately 10 minutes, much faster than the existing graph generators.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: complement graphgraph bandwidthgraphhistogramcluster analysisalgorithm designdata analysisbig datagraph theorydata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer science
Accelerating Active Learning with Transfer Learning,David C. Kale (University of Southern California)Yan Liu (University of Southern California),"2054676105,2240541904","Active learning, transfer learning, and related techniques are unified by a core theme: efficient and effective use of available data. Active learning offers scalable solutions for building effective supervised learning models while minimizing annotation effort. Transfer learning utilizes existing labeled data from one task to help learning related tasks for which limited labeled data are available. There has been limited research, however, on how to combine these two techniques. In this paper, we present a simple and principled transfer active learning framework that leverages pre-existing labeled data from related tasks to improve the performance of an active learner.

Compared to advertising on traditional media, online advertising has rich information as well as necessary techniques to achieve precise user targeting. This rich information includes the search behaviors of a user, such as queries issued, or the ads clicked by the user. For popular websites with large number of active users, ad delivery targeting at individual users puts too much burden on the system. User segmentation is an alternative way to relieve this burden by grouping users of similar interests together, then the ad delivery system targets the user segments to display relevant ads, instead of individual users. Existing user segmentation work either adapts clustering methods without considering the hidden semantics embedded in the data, such as K-means, or treats users as data instance and clusters users indirectly even if the latent semantics is incorporated into the transformed data, such as PLSA or LDA. In this paper, we present a search behavior based latent semantic user segmentation method and validate its effectiveness on new ads. Instead of treating users as data instances, they are used as attributes of user issued queries or clicked ads which are considered to be data instances. LDA is then applied to this data set to directly obtain the user segments.

Can Shared Nearest Neighbors Reduce Hubness in High-Dimensional Spaces?,Arthur Flexer (Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence)Dominik Schnitzer (Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence),"2108214723,2260752381","'Hubness' is a recently discovered general problem of machine learning in high dimensional data spaces. Hub objects have a small distance to an exceptionally large number of data points, and anti-hubs are far from all other data points. It is related to the concentration of distances which impairs the contrast of distances in high dimensional spaces. Computation of secondary distances inspired by shared nearest neighbor (SNN) approaches has been shown to reduce hubness and concentration and there already exists some work on direct application of SNN in the context of hubness in image recognition. This study applies SNN to a larger number of high dimensional real world data sets from diverse domains and compares it to two other secondary distance approaches (local scaling and mutual proximity).

However, they cannot work properly in multi density environments. The existing multi density clustering algorithms have some problems in order to be applicable for data streams such as the need of whole data to perform clustering, two-pass clustering and high execution time. Data stream arrives continuously and they have to be processed in limited time and memory. Therefore, we need an algorithm to cluster data stream with different densities as well as to overcome the challenges in clustering data streams. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Density clustering algorithm for data stream called MuDi-Stream. MuDi-Stream is an online-offline clustering algorithm, in which the online phase forms core-mini-clusters using a new proposed core distance and offline phase clusters the core-mini-clusters based on a density-based method. The new core distance called mini core distance is calculated based on the number of neighboring data points around the core. Therefore, the algorithm has different core distances for different clusters that leads to cover multi density environments. A novel pruning strategy is also used to filter out the real data from the noise by mapping the outliers in the grid. The grid structure keeps the neighbors of the data point to determine mini-core distance and remove noise effectively.

It occurs in many areas of engineering and applied science. In most machine learning and data mining applications, it is possible to leverage the expertise of human oracles to improve the performance of the system. It is therefore natural to extend this idea of ""human-in-the-loop"" to the matrix completion problem. However, considering the enormity of data in the modern era, manually completing all the entries in a matrix will be an expensive process in terms of time, labor and human expertise, human oracles can only provide selective supervision to guide the solution process. Thus, appropriately identifying a subset of missing entries (for manual annotation) in an incomplete matrix is of paramount practical importance, this can potentially lead to better reconstructions of the incomplete matrix with minimal human effort. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms to address this issue. Since the query locations are actively selected by the algorithms, we refer to these methods as active matrix completion algorithms.

Recently, the unsupervised learning methods such as the K-means, self-organizing map (SOM), and growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) have been shown to be able to facilitate network anomaly detection. However, there is no study focusing on mining IP flows with high variability of attacks in an intuitive way. In this study, we leverage the visualization specialty of GHSOM to help analyze the static IP flow data, also called the network traces of victims, to identify any suspicious IP source. The GHSOM can generate a hierarchical architecture based on the input data and help reveal their inherent hierarchical relationships. For example, the geometric distances between each attack pattern and its descriptive information are revealed in the topological space which forms the signature of a botnet. The IP flows clustered by GHSOM are grouped with distinctive connecting features, and the differences between each cluster are visualized with sequential time stamps which can be used to portray various attack patterns, help explore the sources of attacks and understand the behaviors of attacks.

In particular, a probability model is proposed to extract latent features of object roles from dynamic networks. The extracted latent features are discriminative in learning object roles and are capable of characterizing network structures. The probability model is then extended to learn the dynamic patterns and make predictions on object roles.

This representation can be a latent indicator vector denoting the cluster membership (hard clustering), a vector of cluster membership probabilities (soft clustering), or more generally a real-valued vector (latent space representation). Recently, a new class of overlapping stochastic block models has been proposed where the idea is to allow the objects to have hard memberships in multiple clusters (in form of a latent binary vector). This aspect captures the properties of many real-world networks in domains such as biology and social networks where objects can simultaneously have memberships in multiple clusters owing to the multiple roles they may have. In this paper, we improve upon this model in three key ways: (1) we extend the overlapping stochastic block model to the bipartite graph case which enables us to simultaneously learn the overlapping clustering of two different sets of objects in the graph, the unipartite graph is just a special case of our model, (2) we allow objects (in either set) to not have membership in any cluster by using a relevant object selection mechanism, and (3) we make use of additionally available object features (or a kernel matrix of pair wise object similarities) to further improve the overlapping clustering performance. We do this by explicitly encouraging similar objects to have similar cluster membership vectors. Moreover, using nonparametric Bayesian prior distributions on the key model parameters, we side-step the model selection issues such as selecting the number of clusters a priori. Our model is quite general and can be applied for both overlapping clustering and link prediction tasks in unipartite and bipartite networks (directed/undirected), or for overlapping co-clustering of general binary-valued data. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets from biology and social networks demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: flame clusteringdata modelingbipartite graphkernelgraph theorydata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticsmathematics
Decision Support in Data Centers for Sustainability,Michael J. Pawlish (ENVIRON)Aparna S. Varde (Montclair State University)Stefan A. Robila (Montclair State University),"2020472414,74820909,75084740","In this paper, we propose a decision support system (DSS) for the greening of data centers to help the environment, hence promoting sustainability. As society continues the relentless shift towards electronic communications there is a growing demand for greater storage and processing on data centers. A potential area of improvement is to gain greater server utilization rates since traditionally the phenomenon of ""server sprawl"" occurs where more servers are added to the data center without seeking greater utilization rates on existing servers first. This implies maintaining more servers than actually needed that translates to greater carbon dioxide emissions causing potential environmental problems. Presently, average server utilization rates in most data centers are rather low, and we make the claim that utilization rates should be increased so that we can lower the number of servers for enhanced sustainability. A shift to the cloud could potentially be useful here. Some servers can be phased out with their operations being hosted on the cloud instead. We propose an approach based on data mining using CBR and decision trees to build a DSS that would help make decisions pertaining to issues such as server sprawl and migration to the cloud in order to promote data center sustainability. We provide recommendations based on our DSS that would be useful to data center operators in academia and industry.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: green computingcase based reasoningsustainable developmentdecision treedecision support systemdata miningsimulationcomputer science
Pattern Discovery in High Dimensional Binary Data,Peng Jiang (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign)Michael T. Heath (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign),"2507157674,2129730520","High dimensional binary datasets arise in many areas of applications and pose significant challenges in data analysis. Pattern discovery is a key technique for analyzing these datasets. This paper presents algorithms for binary matrix factorization (BMF), which compresses large datasets into a much smaller set of dominant patterns for subsequent applications. BMF refers to the problem of finding two binary matrices of low rank such that the difference between their matrix product and a given binary matrix is minimal. One approximate matrix factor finds the dominant patterns, and the other shows how the original patterns are represented by the dominant ones. The problem of determining the exact optimal solution is NP-hard. We show that BMF is closely related with k-means clustering and propose a clustering approach for BMF. We prove that our approach has approximation ratio of 2. We further propose a randomized clustering algorithm that chooses k cluster centroids randomly based on preassigned probabilities to each point. The randomized clustering algorithm works well for large k. We experimentally demonstrate the nice theoretical properties of BMF on applications in pattern extraction and association rule mining.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: cluster analysisapproximation algorithmdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics

These semi-structured data contain both unstructured features (e.g., plain text) and metadata, such as tags in html files or author and venue information in research articles. It's of great interest to model such kind of data. Most previous works focused on modeling the unstructured data. Some other methods have been proposed to model the unstructured data with specific tags. To build a general model for semi-structured documents remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the tagged documents by a so-called Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation (TWDA). TWDA is a framework that leverages both the tags and words in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e.g., classification, clustering, and recommendations). Moreover, TWDA can automatically infer the probabilistic weights of tags for each document, that can be used to predict the tags in one document. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our TWDA approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods on four corpora in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: topic modeldata modelingprobabilistic logicpredictive modellingestimation theoryprobabilitymathematical modelresource managementtext mininginformation retrievaldata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

The Passenger Demand Prediction Model on Bus Networks,Chunjie Zhou (Ludong University)Pengfei DaiRenpu Li (Ludong University),"2693206469,2674575254,2721039497","Public transport, especially the bus transport, can reduce the private car usage and fuel consumption, and alleviate traffic congestion. However, when traveling with buses, the travelers not only care about the waiting time, but also care about the crowdedness in the bus. Excessively overcrowded bus may drive away the anxious travelers and make them reluctant to take buses. So accurate, real-time and reliable passenger demand prediction becomes necessary, which can help determine the bus headway and help reduce the waiting time of passengers. There are three major challenges for predicting the passenger demand on bus services: inhomogeneous, seasonal bursty periods and periodicities. To overcome the challenges, we propose three predictive models and further take a data stream ensemble framework to predict the number of passengers. Our performance study based on a real dataset of five months' bus data demonstrates that our approach is quite effective: among 86,411 passenger demands on bus services, more than 78% of them are accurately forecasted.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: group method of data handlingpredictive modellingmachine learningsimulationcomputer science

Traffic jams grow, move, shrink and eventually disappear. Public attention shifts among current hot topics inducing a similar shift of highly accessed Wikipedia articles.

Instead, in the approach presented in this paper, we model the relation between aspects and subjective phrases explicitly, exploiting a flexible model based on imperatively defined factor graphs (IDF). The extraction of subjective phrases, aspects and the relation between them is modeled as a joint inference problem and compared to a pure pipeline architecture. Our goal is to analyse and quantify to what extent a joint model outperforms a pipeline model in terms of extraction of aspects, subjective phrases and the relation between them.

Recently developed linear programming and greedy pursuit methods can pick out the anchors from noisy data and results in a near-separable NMF. But their efficiency could be seriously weakened in high dimensions. In this paper, we show that the anchors can be precisely located from low-dimensional geometry of the data points even when their high dimensional features suffer from serious incompleteness. Our framework, entitled divide-and-conquer anchoring (DCA), divides the high-dimensional anchoring problem into a few cheaper sub-problems seeking anchors of data projections in low-dimensional random spaces, which can be solved in parallel by any near-separable NMF, and combines all the detected low-dimensional anchors via a fast hypothesis testing to identify the original anchors. We further develop two non-iterative anchoring algorithms in 1D and 2D spaces for data in convex hull and conical hull, respectively. These two rapid algorithms in the ultra low dimensions suffice to generate a robust and efficient near-separable NMF for high-dimensional or incomplete data via DCA. Compared to existing methods, two vital advantages of DCA are its scalability for big data, and capability of handling incomplete and high-dimensional noisy data. A rigorous analysis proves that DCA is able to find the correct anchors of a rank-k matrix by solving math cal O(klog k) sub-problems. Finally, we show DCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various datasets and tasks.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: group method of data handlingmatrix decompositioniterative methodlinear programmingdiscrete mathematicscombinatoricsmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticsmathematics

Good risk stratification is the key to good personalized care plan design and delivery. The typical procedure for risk stratification is to first identify a set of risk-relevant medical features (also called risk factors), and then construct a predictive model to estimate the risk scores for individual patients. However, due to the heterogeneity of patients' clinical conditions, the risk factors and their importance vary across different patient groups. Therefore a better approach is to first segment the patient cohort into a set of homogeneous groups with consistent clinical conditions, namely risk groups, and then develop group-specific risk prediction models.

To probe such users thus becomes critically important for a healthy Weibo, but the existing studies along this line are still in initial stage due to the serious lack of labeled zombies and the limited attributes for user profiling. In light of this, in this paper, we figure out a commercial way for training set labeling, and propose a two-stage cascading model called ProZombie for zombie user recognition. ProZombie decomposes the training/predicting process into fast and refined phases in cascade, which greatly improves the modeling efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. Moreover, 35 attributes including 16 newly proposed ones are employed for a panoramic description of Weibo users. Experiments on real-world labeled Weibo users demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ProZombie.

Marketing campaigns stimulate consumer awareness, interest and help drive interactions such as the browsing of product web pages, ultimately impacting an individual's purchase decision. In addition, some successful campaigns stimulate word-of-mouth and social trends among consumers, and such collective behavior of consumers result in concurrent and correlated responses over a short term. Though each consumer's response should be attributed with both the same individual's experiences and the collective factors, unobservability of most word-of-mouth events makes the estimation challenging. The authors propose a new continuous-time predictive model for time-dependent response rates of each consumer, which can incorporate both the individual and the collective factors without explicit word-of-mouth observations. The individual factor is modeled as staircase functions associated with the experienced events by each consumer, and provides a clear psychological interpretation about how marketing advertising communications impact short-term and mid-term memories of consumers. The collective factor is modeled with aggregate response frequencies for mutually-interacting groups that are automatically estimated from data. The key idea to mine the mutually-interacting groups exists in a three-step estimator, which initially performs a Poisson regression without the collective factor, then does clustering of the residual time-series in the initial regression, and finally performs another Poisson regression involving the collective factor. The proposed collective factor robustly incorporates the underlying trends even when causality from one consumer's event spikes to another consumer's response is weak.

However, diversity is a challenging problem as it involves modeling the relationship between sentences during ranking, where traditional methods usually tackle it in a heuristic or implicit way. In this paper, we propose a novel relational learning-to-rank approach (R-LTR) to solve this problem. Relational learning-to-rank is a new learning framework which further incorporates relationships into traditional learning-to-rank in an elegant way. Specifically, the ranking function is defined as the combination of content-based score of individual sentence, and relation-based score between the current sentence and those already selected. On this basis, we propose to learn the ranking function by minimizing the likelihood loss based on Plackett-Luce model, which can naturally model the sequential ranking procedure of candidate sentences. Stochastic gradient descent is then employed to conduct the learning process, and the summary is predicted by the greedy selection procedure based on the learned ranking function. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark data sets TAC2008 and TAC2009. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods from both quantitative and qualitative aspects.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: ranking svmstochastic processdata miningpattern recognitionartificial intelligencemachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics
Support Vector Machines for Uplift Modeling,Łukasz Zaniewicz (Polish Academy of Sciences)Szymon Jaroszewicz (Polish Academy of Sciences),"2343575078,115085028","Uplift modeling is a branch of Machine Learning which aims to predict not the class itself, but the difference between the class variable behavior in two groups: treatment and control. Objects in the treatment group have been subject to some action, while objects in the control group have not. By including the control group it is possible to build a model which predicts the causal effect of the action for a given individual. In this paper we present a variant of Support Vector Machines designed specifically for uplift modeling. The SVM optimization task has been reformulated to explicitly model the difference in class behavior between two datasets. The model predicts whether a given object will have a positive, neutral or negative response to a given action, and by tuning a parameter of the model the analyst is able to influence the relative proportion of neutral predictions and thus the sensitivity of the model. We adapt the dual coordinate descent method to efficiently solve our optimization task.

To the best of our knowledge, from the computational aspect of social influence analysis, most of existing work focus on either describing the influence propagation process or identifying the set of most influential seed nodes. However, these work usually do not distinguish the ""independent influence"" of each single seed node after removing other seeds. Since it is important to quickly figure out the real contribution of each seed, in this paper we propose to measure the seed's independent influence by a linear social influence model. Specifically, we first describe the linear social influence model, and then define the independent influence under this model for eliminating the ""mutual enrichment"" between seed nodes. Meanwhile, we find that the influence of a set of nodes is actually the sum of their independent influence, and we also give upper bounds for independent influence. Moreover, these findings are evaluated by two applications, i.e., ranking the seeds by their independent influence and identifying the Top-K influential ones. Finally, the experimental results on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed independent social influence measures.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: rankingsocial influencecomputational modelupper and lower boundsmathematical modeltheoretical computer sciencedata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

The masking index is critical for data quality profiling and data exploration, it enables a user to measure the extent of masking and hence the confidence in the data. In this sense, it is a valuable data quality index for measuring the true cleanliness of the data.

Through these platforms, users can collect, monitor and share with friends their sport performance, diet, and even burned calories, giving an unprecedented opportunity to answer very fascinating questions: What are the main factors that shape sport performance? What are the characteristics that distinguish successful sportsmen? Can we characterize the role of social influence on fitness behavior? In the current work, we present the results of a study conducted on a sample of 29, 284 cyclists downloaded via APIs from the social fitness platform Strava.com. We defined two basic metrics: a measure of training effort, that is how much a cyclist struggled during the workout, and a measure of training performance indicating the results achieved during the training. Analyzing the relationship between these two metrics, an interesting result immediately emerges: at a global level, there is no correlation between effort and performance. This means that, in general, the performance is not simply a function of training: two athletes with the same level of training have different performance. However, by deeply investigating workouts time evolution and cyclists' training characteristics, we found that athletes that better improve their performance follow precise training patterns usually referred as overcompensation theory, with alternation of stress peaks and rest periods. Studies and experiments related to such theory, up to now, have always been conducted by sports doctors on a few dozen professionals athletes.

Transform Residual K-Means Trees for Scalable Clustering,Jiangbo Yuan (Florida State University)Xiuwen Liu (Florida State University),"2159115434,2155972192","The K-means problem, i.e., to partition a dataset into K clusters is a fundamental problem common to numerous data mining applications. As it is an NP-hard problem, iterative optimizations are typically used such as the K-means algorithm to compute cluster centers. As the K-means algorithm is exponential both in computation and storage in terms of required bits to encode cluster centers, approaches with low computation and storage complexity have been actively studied both for signal compression under real-time constraints and for clustering of large scale high-dimensional datasets. By generating cluster centers via Cartesian products of cluster centers in multiple groups or multiple stages, product and residual K-means trees reduce computation and storage complexity, making it possible to cluster large scale datasets. As residual K-means trees do not require assumed statistical independence among groups that are required by product K-means trees, they generally give better clustering quality. A known limitation of residual K-means trees is that the gain diminishes with added stages. In this paper, by identifying increased intrinsic dimensions of residual vectors with more stages as a limiting factor of performance due to the curse of dimensionality, we propose transform residual K-means trees as a generalization by applying cluster specific transforms to increase the correlations of residual vectors. Our methods substantially reduce the increase of intrinsic dimensions and therefore increase the effectiveness of multiple-stage residual Kmeans trees.

Our hypothesis is based on the assumption, that even though images are obtained from different sensors and at different times, the underlying basis in the scene is still the same, since they are different representations of the same reality. In other words, different sensors capture overlapping information in different forms. Thus, we expect that similarity measures provides contrasting information for change vs. no change patches.

"Dimensionality, Discriminability, Density and Distance Distributions",Michael E. Houle (National Institute of Informatics),2088104168,"For many large-scale applications in data mining, machine learning, and multimedia, fundamental operations such as similarity search, retrieval, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection generally suffer from an effect known as the `curse of dimensionality'. As the dimensionality of the data increases, distance values tend to become less discriminative, due to their increasing relative concentration about the mean of their distribution. For this reason, researchers have considered the analysis of structures and methods in terms of measures of the intrinsic dimensionality of the data sets. This paper is concerned with a generalization of a discrete measure of intrinsic dimensionality, the expansion dimension, to the case of continuous distance distributions. This notion of the intrinsic dimensionality of a distribution is shown to precisely coincide with a natural notion of the indiscriminability of distances and features. Furthermore, for any distance distribution with differentiable cumulative density function, a fundamental relationship is shown to exist between probability density, the cumulative density (cumulative probability divided by distance), intrinsic dimensionality, and discriminability.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: featurecurse of dimensionalitydata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

The modern solution to this problem is the Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF). The problem with applying a GMRF to very high-dimensional data imputation is that while the GMRF model itself can be useful even for data having tens of thousands of dimensions, utilizing a GMRF requires access to a sparsified, inverse covariance matrix for the data. Computing this matrix using even state-of-the-art methods is very costly, as it typically requires first estimating the covariance matrix from the data (at a O(nm2) cost for m dimensions and n data points) and then performing a regularized inversion of the estimated covariance matrix, which is also very expensive. This is impractical for even moderately-sized, high-dimensional data sets. In this paper, we propose a very simple alternative to the GMRF called the pair wise Gaussian random field or PGRF for short. The PGRF is a graphical, factor-based model. Unlike traditional Gaussian or GMRF models, a PGRF does not require a covariance or correlation matrix as input. Instead, a PGRF takes as input a set of p (dimension, dimension) pairs for which the user suspects there might be a strong correlation or anti-correlation. This set of pairs defines the graphical structure of the model, with a simple Gaussian factor associated with each of the p (dimension, dimension) pairs. Using this structure, it is easy to perform simultaneous inference and imputation of the model. The key benefit of the approach is that the time required for the PGRF to perform inference is approximately linear with respect to p, where p will typically be much smaller than the number of entries in a m×m covariance or precision matrix.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingimputationgaussian processcorrelationnormal distributionmarkov processcomputational modelcomputational complexity theorybiological classificationmonte carlo methodstochastic processeconometricsmachine learningstatisticsmathematics

Sky Net combines multiple techniques already developed individually in the literature to create an efficient and robust machine-learning tool that is able to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks for use in a wide range of learning applications, such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sky Net uses a powerful `pre-training' method, to obtain a set of network parameters close to the true global maximum of the training objective function, followed by further optimisation using an automatically-regularised variant of Newton's method that uses second-order derivative information to improve convergence, but without the need to evaluate or store the full Hessian matrix, by using a fast approximate method to calculate Hessian-vector products. This combination of methods allows for the training of complicated networks that are difficult to optimise using standard back propagation techniques. The blind accelerated multimodal Bayesian inference (BAMBI) algorithm implements the MultiNest package for nested sampling as well as the training of an artificial neural network by Sky Net to learn the likelihood function. In the case of computationally expensive likelihoods, this allows the substitution of a much more rapid approximation in order to increase significantly the speed of the analysis.

Permutation-Based Sequential Pattern Hiding,Robert Gwadera (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne)Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis (IBM)Grigorios Loukides (Cardiff University),"328419335,57288862,68021724","Sequence data are increasingly shared to enable mining applications, in various domains such as marketing, telecommunications, and healthcare. This, however, may expose sensitive sequential patterns, which lead to intrusive inferences about individuals or leak confidential information about organizations. This paper presents the first permutation-based approach to prevent this threat. Our approach hides sensitive patterns by replacing them with carefully selected permutations that avoid changes in the set of frequent nonsensitive patterns (side-effects) and in the ordering information of sequences (distortion). By doing so, it retains data utility in sequence mining and tasks based on item set properties, as permutation preserves the support of items, unlike deletion, which is used in existing works. To realize our approach, we develop an efficient and effective algorithm for generating permutations with minimal side-effects and distortion. This algorithm also avoids implausible symbol orderings that may exist in certain applications. In addition, we propose a method to hide sensitive patterns from a sequence dataset. Extensive experiments verify that our method allows significantly more accurate data analysis than the state-of the-art approach.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: permutationinsurancepattern matchingdistortioninformation privacytheoretical computer sciencedata miningdatabasecomputer science

Our research shows that, similar to the single-instance imbalance problem, classification of multi-instance data with imbalanced class distributions significantly degrades performance when compared to most standard multi-instance algorithms in a balanced setting. Due to the inherent differences between multi-instance and single-instance learning, the existing solutions for single-instance class imbalance problems do not transfer directly to multi-instance datasets. This is a drawback, as imbalanced multi-instance problems often occur in data mining practice. In this paper, we propose two solution frameworks for multi-instance class imbalanced datasets.

Efficient Invariant Search for Distributed Information Systems,Yong Ge (University of North Carolina at Charlotte)Guofei Jiang (NEC)Yuan Ge,"2218492437,2168090285,2444441249","In today's distributed information systems, a large amount of monitoring data such as log files have been collected. These monitoring data at various points of a distributed information system provide unparallel opportunities for us to characterize and track the information system via effectively correlating all monitoring data across the distributed system. Jiang1 proposed a concept named flow intensity to measure the intensity with which the monitoring data reacts to the volume of different user requests. The Autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) was used to quantify the relationship between each pair of flow intensity measured at various points across distributed systems. If such relationships hold all the time, they are considered as invariants of the underlying systems. Such invariants have been successfully used to characterize complex systems and support various system management tasks, such as system fault detection and localization. However, it is very time-consuming to search the complete set of invariants of large scale systems and existing algorithms are not scalable for thousands of flow intensity measurements. To this end, in this paper, we develop effective pruning techniques based on the identified upper bounds. Accordingly, two efficient algorithms are proposed to search the complete set of invariants based on the pruning techniques.

It is still a challenge to study how CNVs play a role in driving tumorgenic mechanisms that are either universal or specific in different cancer types. To address the problem, we introduce a transfer learning framework to discover common CNVs shared across different tumor types as well as CNVs specific to each tumor type from genome-wide CNV data measured by array CGH and SNP genotyping array. The proposed model, namely Transfer Learning with Fused LASSO (TLFL), detects latent CNV components from multiple CNV datasets of different tumor types to distinguish the CNVs that are common across the datasets and those that are specific in each dataset. Both the common and type-specific CNVs are detected as latent components in matrix factorization coupled with fused LASSO on adjacent CNV probe features. TLFL considers the common latent components underlying the multiple datasets to transfer knowledge across different tumor types. In simulations and experiments on real cancer CNV datasets, TLFL detected better latent components that can be used as features to improve classification of patient samples in each individual dataset compared with the model without the knowledge transfer. In cross-dataset analysis on bladder cancer and cross-domain analysis on breast cancer and ovarian cancer, TLFL also learned latent CNV components that are both predictive of tumor stages and correlate with known cancer genes.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: transfer of learningmatrix decompositioncancerdnabioinformaticsmachine learningcomputer science

Recently, there are many studies which focus on discovering communities successively from each snapshot by considering both current and historical information. However, the detected communities are isolated at a certain snapshot, because these approaches ignore important historical or successive information. Different from previous studies which focus on community detection in dynamic networks, we define a new problem of tracking the progression of the community strength - a novel measure that reflects the community robustness and coherence throughout the entire observation period. The proposed community strength analysis provides significant insights into entity properties and relationships in a wide variety of applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel two-stage framework: we first identify communities via non-negative matrix factorization, and then calculate the strength of each detected community corresponding to each specific snapshot by solving an optimization problem.

Blazing Fast Time Series Segmentation Based on Update Techniques for Polynomial Approximations,Andre Gensler (University of Kassel)Thiemo Gruber (University of Kassel)Bernhard Sick (University of Kassel),"2115666011,2609262829,2077178283","Segmentation is an important step in processing and analyzing time series. In this article, we present an approach to speed up some standard time series segmentation techniques. Often, time series segmentation is based on piecewise polynomial approximations of the time series (including piecewise constant or linear approximations as special cases). Basically, a least-squares fit with a polynomial has a computational complexity that depends on the number of observations, i.e., the length of the time series. To improve the computational complexity of segmentation techniques we exploit the fact that approximations have to be repeated in sliding (moving) or growing time windows. Therefore, we suggest to use update techniques for the approximations that determine the approximating polynomial in a sliding or growing time window from an already existing one with a computational complexity that is independent of the number of observations, i.e., the length of the window. For that purpose bases of orthogonal polynomials must be used instead of standard bases such as monomials. We take two standard techniques for segmentation - the on-line algorithm SWAB (Sliding Window And Bottom-up) and the off-line technique OptSeg (Optimal Segmentation) - and show that the run-times can be reduced substantially for a given polynomial degree. If run-time constraints are given, e.g., in real-time applications, it would also be possible to adapt the degree of the approximating polynomials. Higher polynomial degrees typically result in lower modeling errors or longer segments. The various properties of the new realizations of segmentation techniques are outlined by means of some benchmark time series. The experimental results show that, depending on the chosen parameterization, OptSeg can be accelerated by some orders of magnitude, SWAB by a factor of up to about ten.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: time seriesapproximation algorithmdiscrete mathematicscombinatoricsmachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticsmathematics
Towards the Integration of Constrained Mining with Star Schemas,Andreia Silva (University of Lisbon)Claudia Antunes (University of Lisbon),"2165533671,2081435542","A growing challenge in data mining is the ability to deal with complex, voluminous and dynamic data. In many real world applications, complex data is organized in multiple inter-related database tables, which makes their analysis as a whole more difficult and challenging. The most used multi-dimensional model in data warehouses represents data through star schemas, that consist of a central fact table, linking a set of dimensional tables, representing respectively the business events and dimensions. There are few techniques dedicated to the analysis of these star schemas, with the aim of finding frequent co-occurrences, or patterns, in data, and both suffer from the lack of focus on user expectations. Indeed, one of the common criticisms pointed out to the pattern discovery task is the fact that it generates a huge number of patterns, independent of user expertise, making it very hard to analyze and use the results. Constrained mining is the most used approach to minimize these problems, by applying user defined constraints to filter and focus the discovery process. In this work we propose the integration of these two important areas of data mining, and discuss how this can be done using the already existing techniques.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data stream miningdata warehousedata sciencedata miningdatabasecomputer science

LP is strongly motivated by social search and recommendation applications. LP techniques often focus on global properties (graph conductance, hitting or commute times, Katz score) or local properties (Adamic-Adar and many variations, or node feature vectors), but rarely combine these signals. Furthermore, neither of these extremes exploit link densities at the intermediate level of communities. In this paper we describe a discriminative LP algorithm that exploits two new signals. First, a co-clustering algorithm provides community level link density estimates, which are used to qualify observed links with a surprise value. Second, links in the immediate neighborhood of the link to be predicted are interpreted %at face value, but through a local model of node feature similarities. These signals are combined into a discriminative link predictor. We evaluate the new predictor using five diverse data sets that are standard in the literature. We report on significant accuracy boosts compared to standard LP methods (including Adamic-Adar and random walk).

Most Clusters Can Be Retrieved with Short Disjunctive Queries,Vinay Deolalikar (Hewlett-Packard),2150307071,"Simple keyword based searches are ubiquitous in today's internet age. It is hard to imagine an information system today that does not permit a simple keyword based search. This method of information retrieval has the obvious benefits of being highly interpretable, and having wide usage. However, a general perception is that keyword search may not be as powerful an information retrieval paradigm as those that utilize data mining technologies. At the same time, the tremendous growth in textual information in various domains has also given impetus to data mining technologies such as document clustering. Document clustering is a powerful technique, having wide applications in enterprise information management (EIM). However, there is a general perception that the clusters it produces are not always easily interpretable. This hampers its usage in certain settings. This leads us to the following question: can we retrieve a cluster (from a corpus) using a keyword search with precision and recall that are reasonable from the point of view of a retrieval system? What is the form of such a keyword search? How many keywords do we require? How do we arrive at these keywords? Not only are these questions natural, they have immediate use in several highly regulated applications in EIM such as eDiscovery and compliance, where document sets must be specified using keywords. In order to answer our question, we construct a framework that uses maximal frequent discriminative item sets. The novelty of our usage of these item sets is that although their definition as frequent item sets is conjunctive, we use them to form a disjunctive query upon the corpus. We then study the results of this query as an information retrieval problem whose target is the cluster. Our study yields a surprising result: most clusters can be retrieved, up to reasonable precision and recall, using a disjunctive query of only three terms. Among other ramifications, this gives us a readily interpretable description of a cluster in terms of the disjunctive query that returns it.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: organizationinformation systemcluster analysisdocument clusteringtext mininginformation retrievaldata miningdatabasecomputer science

Yet, many other models may be equally likely, and so a more informative result is provided by Bayesian structure discovery. Bayesian structure discovery algorithms estimate posterior probabilities of structural features, such as edges.

Efficient computation requires that our transfer learning objective factors into local calculations, which we prove is given by a broad class of transfer biases.

By doing so, we reveal and justify the potential impacts of URL position on inferring intrinsic QURs. Inspired by this finding, a position-sensitive model (PSM) is proposed to infer QURs more accurately.

Constrained Clustering: Effective Constraint Propagation with Imperfect Oracles,Xiatian Zhu (Queen Mary University of London)Chen Change Loy (The Chinese University of Hong Kong)Shaogang Gong (Queen Mary University of London),"2116756113,2123758277,2161448407","While spectral clustering is usually an unsupervised operation, there are circumstances in which we have prior belief that pairs of samples should (or should not) be assigned with the same cluster. Constrained spectral clustering aims to exploit this prior belief as constraint (or weak supervision) to influence the cluster formation so as to obtain a structure more closely resembling human perception. Two important issues remain open: (1) how to propagate sparse constraints effectively, (2) how to handle ill-conditioned/noisy constraints generated by imperfect oracles. In this paper we present a unified framework to address the above issues. Specifically, in contrast to existing constrained spectral clustering approaches that blindly rely on all features for constructing the spectral, our approach searches for neighbours driven by discriminative feature selection for more effective constraint diffusion. Crucially, we formulate a novel data-driven filtering approach to handle the noisy constraint problem, which has been unrealistically ignored in constrained spectral clustering literature.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: constrained clusteringspectral clusteringlocal consistencyvegetationnoise measurementmathematical modelfeature selectiondata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningmathematical optimizationcomputer sciencemathematics

A Novel Structural AR Modeling Approach for a Continuous Time Linear Markov System,Marina Demeshko (Osaka University)Takashi Washio (Osaka University)Yoshinobu Kawahara (Osaka University),"2025487095,1794038515,2167354121","We often use a discrete time vector autoregressive (DVAR) model to analyse continuous time, multivariate, linear Markov systems through their time series data sampled at discrete time steps. However, the DVAR model has been considered not to be structural representation and hence not to have bijective correspondence with system dynamics in general. In this paper, we characterize the relationships of the DVAR model with its corresponding structural vector AR (SVAR) and continuous time vector AR (CVAR) models through finite difference approximation of time differentials. Our analysis shows that the DVAR model of a continuous time, multivariate, linear Markov system bijectively corresponds to the system dynamics. Further we clarify that the SVAR and the CVAR models are uniquely reproduced from their DVAR model under a highly generic condition.

In recent years many ensemble clustering methods have been proposed, most of which treat each clustering and each object as equally important. Some approaches make use of weights associated with clusters, or with clusterings, when assembling the different base clusterings. Boosting algorithms developed for classification have also led to the idea of considering weighted objects during the clustering process. However, not much effort has been put towards incorporating weighted objects into the consensus process. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose an approach called Weighted-Object Ensemble Clustering (WOEC). We first estimate how difficult it is to cluster an object by constructing the co-association matrix that summarizes the base clustering results, and we then embed the corresponding information as weights associated to objects. We propose three different consensus techniques to leverage the weighted objects. All three reduce the ensemble clustering problem to a graph partitioning one.

Discovering Non-redundant Overlapping Biclusters on Gene Expression Data,Duy Tin Truong (University of Trento)Roberto Battiti (University of Trento)Mauro Brunato (University of Trento),"2133220559,57182601,323418578","Given a gene expression data matrix where each cell is the expression level of a gene under a certain condition, biclustering is the problem of searching for a subset of genes that co regulate and co express only under a subset of conditions. As some genes can belong to different functional categories, searching for non-redundant overlapping biclusters is an important problem in biclustering. However, most recent algorithms can only either produce disjoint biclusters or redundant biclusters with significant overlap. In other words, these algorithms do not allow users to specify the maximum overlap between the biclusters. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm which can generate K overlapping biclusters where the maximum overlap between them is below a predefined threshold. Unlike the other approaches which often generate all biclusters at once, our algorithm produces the biclusters sequentially, where each newly generated bicluster is guaranteed to be different from the previous ones but can still overlap with them. The experiments on real datasets confirm that different meaningful overlapping biclusters are successfully discovered. Besides, under the same constraints, our algorithm returns much larger and higher-quality biclusters compared to those of the other state-of-the art algorithms.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: bioinformaticsdata miningmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics

We exploit these structure primitives for effective graph compression using the Minimum Description Length Principle. The compression rate is an unbiased measure for the transitivity or hub ness and therefore provides interesting insights into the structure of even very sparse graphs.

Calculation and Applications of Bayesian Evidence in Astrophysics and Particle Physics Phenomenology,Farhan Feroz (University of Cambridge),2184630480,"Bayesian inference is usually divided into two categories: parameter estimation and model selection. Parameter estimation is mostly performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, most often based on the standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm or its variants, such as slice, Gibbs' and Hamiltonian sampling. These methods can be highly inefficient in exploring multi-modal distributions or ones exhibiting degeneracies between parameters. Moreover, in order to perform Bayesian model selection, estimation of Bayesian evidence is needed which is by definition, a (possibly high dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space. Unfortunately, the computational expense involved in the evaluation of Bayesian evidence is typically an order of magnitude higher than doing the parameter estimation. In this paper, we discuss some techniques, built around the nested sampling framework, that have been developed to efficiently calculate the Bayesian evidence. We also discuss applications of Bayesian evidence in astrophysics and particle physics, in problems involving model selection, source detection, consistency checks between different data-sets, multi-model inference and in determining the constraining power of different observables.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: variable order bayesian networkbayesian averagebayesian linear regressionrecursive bayesian estimationfree energy principlemarginal likelihoodellipsoidbayesian statisticsdata modelingmodel selectionbayesian inferencebayesian probabilitymarkov processcomputational modelestimation theorydata analysismonte carlo methodeconometricsmachine learningstatisticsmathematics

With exposure, dangerously low blood pressure results from diminished blood production forces the heart to beat at abnormal rates and causes damage. The heart, like the other muscles of the body, risk developing muscular atrophy from the reduced dependence on muscle-use. Oxidative carbonylation, the addition of a CO to an amino acid chain, is a natural process used by the cell to degrade and remove proteins. This reaction may also cause many of the diseases associated with protein dysfunction (Alzheimer's, muscular atrophy, Parkinsons, sepsis, etc.). Although aging has been associated with similar ailments from protein degradation, the stress from weightlessness is thought to increase the rates of oxidative processes impacting general health by upsetting protein function and its structure. Carbonylation is an oxidative reaction for which, motifs high in R, K, P, T, E and S residues can be used to explore its composition in protein data. Since mitochondria also apply oxidative processes to make energy, we hypothesize that this reaction is highly contained so as to minimize local oxidative damage. In this paper, we evaluate the coverage of motifs which are likely attractors of oxidative activity across mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial protein data of fourteen diverse organisms. Here we show that mitochondrial proteins have generally reduced amounts of the same oxidative carbonylation content which we found in abundance in the organism's nuclear proteins. Furthermore, we show that this general finding is similar between two major profiling systems: oxidative carbonylation (RKPT enriched sequences) and protein degradation (PEST sequences). We suggest an mitochondrial intolerance for motifs that may attract forms of oxidation.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: carbonylationmicro g environmentorganismmusclemitochondrionsequenceredoxprotein sequencingmolecular biophysicsgeriatricsbioinformatics

Six-sigma and Lean Management approaches are useful statistical techniques in this context. In the practical application of such techniques, the process analyst is often restricted by the semantic expressiveness of the process analysis models. Many popular process modeling techniques also suffer from limitations in the adequate representation of probabilistic behavior in processes. The latter is important, for example, for detecting the impact of exceptions and variations in processes. In this paper additional techniques are proposed based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). This is primarily based on the semantic richness of FCA-schema's, which are algebraic lattices. It is shown how many-to-many transitions in processes can easily be identified in an FCA-based Process representation. These transitions are not only the expression of potential Value Leaks as they also lead to explanations of their root causes.

As a result, the minority class is not well represented which leads to high misclassification error. We introduce wRACOG, a Gibbs sampling-based over sampling approach to synthetically generating and strategically selecting new minority class samples. The Gibbs sampler uses the joint probability distribution of data attributes to generate new minority class samples in the form of a Markov chain. wRACOG iteratively learns a model by selecting samples from the Markov chain that have the highest probability of being misclassified.

In addition, emerging challenges such as overlapping classes, make class imbalance even harder to solve.

One of the central problems in this area is the problem of identifying influencers, such that by convincing these users to perform a certain action (like buying a new product), a large number of other users get influenced to follow the action. The client of such an application is essentially a marketer who would target these influencers for marketing a given new product, say by providing free samples or discounts. It is natural that before committing resources for targeting an influencer the marketer would be interested in validating the influence (or network value) of influencers returned. This requires digging deeper into such analytical questions as: who are their followers, on what actions (or products) they are influential, etc. However, the current approaches to identifying influencers largely work as a black box in this respect. The goal of this paper is to open up the black box, address these questions and provide informative and crisp explanations for validating the network value of influencers. We formulate the problem of providing explanations (called PROXI) as a discrete optimization problem of feature selection. We show that PROXI is not only NP-hard to solve exactly, it is NP-hard to approximate within any reasonable factor. Nevertheless, we show interesting properties of the objective function and develop an intuitive greedy heuristic. We perform detailed experimental analysis on two real world datasets - Twitter and Flixster, and show that our approach is useful in generating concise and insightful explanations of the influence distribution of users and that our greedy algorithm is effective and efficient with respect to several baselines.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: viral marketinggreedy algorithmsocial networkalgorithm designcomputational complexity theoryfeature selectioncombinatoricsworld wide webdata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningalgorithmcomputer science
Efficient Visualization of Large-Scale Data Tables through Reordering and Entropy Minimization,Nemanja Djuric (Temple University)Slobodan Vucetic (Temple University),"2128657275,2012499344","Visualization of data tables with n examples and m columns using heat maps provides a holistic view of the original data. As there are n! ways to order rows and m! ways to order columns, and data tables are typically ordered without regard to visual inspection, heat maps of the original data tables often appear as noisy images. However, if rows and columns of a data table are ordered such that similar rows and similar columns are grouped together, a heat map may provide a deep insight into the underlying data distribution. We propose an information-theoretic approach to produce a well-ordered data table. In particular, we search for ordering that minimizes entropy of residuals of predictive coding applied on the ordered data table. This formalization leads to a novel ordering procedure, EM-ordering, that can be applied separately on rows and columns. For ordering of rows, EM-ordering repeats until convergence the steps of (1) rescaling columns and (2) solving a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where rows are treated as cities. To allow fast ordering of large data tables, we propose an efficient TSP heuristic with modest O(n log(n)) time complexity. When compared to the existing state-of-the-art reordering approaches, we show that the method often provides heat maps of higher visual quality, while being significantly more scalable. Moreover, analysis of real-world traffic and financial data sets using the proposed method, which allowed us to readily gain deeper insights about the data, further confirmed that EM-ordering can be a valuable tool for visual exploration of large-scale data sets.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: entropycomputational complexity theorydata visualizationtheoretical computer sciencedata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics
Simulated Annealing Partitioning: An Algorithm for Optimizing Grouping in Cancer Data,"Ran Qi (University of Maryland, Baltimore)Shujia Zhou (University of Maryland, Baltimore)","2439954976,2494936251","Cancer survival prediction usually depends on a clinically useful classification scheme. Grouping in cancer datasets is needed for this classification process [1]. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) is a classical clustering algorithm that is often used to group cancer data. PAM is known to be an NP-hard optimization problem and its practical application is often tackled with heuristic methods [2]. However, many heuristic PAM algorithms may converge to local minimums that adversely affect the quality of grouping results. It is therefore desirable to devise an algorithm to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we demonstrate that simulated annealing (SA) is an effective method for obtaining or approaching to a global optimum. First, we present a grouping algorithm for cancer data, and then optimize the grouping quality of PAM with SA. The experimental results show that the Simulated Annealing PAM (SA-PAM) algorithm is always capable of finding a global minimum or closer approximation to the global minimum than the standard PAM algorithm.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: adaptive simulated annealingglobal optimumcancercluster analysissimulated annealingcomputational complexity theoryapproximation algorithmtheoretical computer sciencemachine learningmathematical optimizationcomputer science

However, the technology is still in its nascent state. Distilling sentiment information from unstructured sources has turned out to be a complicated and strongly domain-dependent problem. To emulate the human ability to recognize financial sentiments in natural language by using machines, we need to provide them with (i) necessary ontological knowledge on the relevant domain-concepts, and (ii) learning strategies that help the machines to combine this knowledge with the syntactic structures extracted from text. In this paper, we present a knowledge-driven tree kernel framework for sentence-level analysis of financial news sentiments. Comparisons with linear kernels and classical lexicon-based systems suggest that significant performance gains can be achieved by incorporating information on financial concepts and their grammatical context. The framework is decomposable into learning, knowledge and syntactic structure components. Contribution of each part is separately examined using a human-annotated phrase-bank with close to 5000 sentences collected across a number of financial news sources. The proposed sentiment analysis framework is flexible and can be applied also outside financial domain.

Unfortunately, for online social network services such as Facebook or Twitter, it is very difficult to obtain the fully observed network without privilege to access the data internally. To address the above needs, social network sampling is a means that aims at identifying a representative subgraph that preserves certain properties of the network, given the information of any instance in the network is unknown before being sampled. This study tackles heterogeneous network sampling by considering the conditional dependency of node types and link types, where we design a property, Relational Profile, to account such characterization. We further propose a sampling method to preserve this property. Lastly, we propose to evaluate our model from three different angles. First, we show that the proposed sampling method can more faithfully preserve the Relational Profile. Second, we evaluate the usefulness of the Relational Profile showing such information is beneficial for link prediction tasks. Finally, we evaluate whether the networks sampled by our method can be used to train more accurate prediction models comparing to networks produced by other methods.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: dynamic network analysissamplinggraph theorytheoretical computer sciencedata miningmachine learningcomputer science

In a first approach, this issue is related to both the quality of service (which is mainly in the front-office, say the contact center) and the speed of service, which is mainly in the back-office. Many studies published to date on this required manual data collection. This creates in general two concerns: worker behavior may change under observation, and manual data collection is expensive and often error prone. In this paper it is shown by means of a case study for a Multi-National Bank (with 5000 employees in the back office) how automated Business Process Discovery, which is an advanced type of process mining, makes it possible to handle the above concerns. The automated data collection and the analysis, in terms of Hidden Markov Models, are key elements. Several results regarding the quality and speed of service have been obtained. Most interesting was the discovery of deeper root causes for customer attrition.

Previous work has focused on algorithm selection or improved light curve representations, and naively convert light curves into structured feature sets without regard for the time span or phase of the light curves. In this paper, we highlight the violation of a fundamental machine learning assumption that occurs when archival light curves with long observational time spans are used to train classifiers that are applied to light curves with fewer observations. We propose two solutions to deal with the mismatch in the time spans of training and test light curves. The first is the use of classifier committees where each classifier is trained on light curves of different observational time spans. Only the committee member whose training set matches the test light curve time span is invoked for classification. The second solution uses hierarchical classifiers that are able to predict source types both individually and by sub-group, so that the user can trade-off an earlier, more robust classification with classification granularity. We test both methods using light curves from the MACHO survey, and demonstrate their usefulness in improving performance over similar methods that naively train on all available archival data.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: lensradio frequencyaccuracy and precisionrobustnessfeature extractiontime seriessupervised learningopticsmachine learningstatisticscomputer science

Current pinpoint forecasts of severe hail rely on detection of hail in existing storms with radar-based methods. Predictions beyond an hour are limited to probabilistic predictions over larger areas based on expected environmental conditions. This paper describes a technique that could increase the accuracy of severe hail forecasts by incorporating output from an ensemble of storm scale numerical weather prediction models into a spatiotemporal relational data mining model that would produce probabilistic predictions of severe hail. The spatiotemporal relational framework represents the ensemble output as a network of storm objects connected by spatial relationships. Composites of the ensemble data show spatial biases in the placement of severe and non severe hail storms. The spatiotemporal relational model performs significantly better at discriminating between severe and non-severe hail compared to a traditional data mining model of the same type.

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. The goal of fairness-aware classifiers is to classify data while taking into account the potential issues of fairness, discrimination, neutrality, and/or independence. In this paper, after reviewing fairness-aware classification methods, we focus on one such method, Calders and Verwer's two-naive-Bayes method. This method has been shown superior to the other classifiers in terms of fairness, which is formalized as the statistical independence between a class and a sensitive feature. However, the cause of the superiority is unclear, because it utilizes a somewhat heuristic post-processing technique rather than an explicitly formalized model. We clarify the cause by comparing this method with an alternative naive Bayes classifier, which is modified by a modeling technique called ""hypothetical fair-factorization.""

Mining Semantic Time Period Similarity in Spatio-Temporal Climate Data,Michael P. McGuire (Towson University)Ziying Tang (Towson University),"2311972679,2674471997","Over the last decade, advances in high performance computing and remote sensing have produced a vast amount of spatio-temporal data. One area that this data explosion is most prevalent is climate science. With this in mind, there is an increasing need to characterize large spatio-temporal datasets. One such characterization is to find periods of time that exhibit the same spatio-temporal pattern. The focus of this research is to find similar spatio-temporal patterns for semantic time periods. A semantic time period could be any arbitrary division in time such as year, month, or week. The proposed approach first characterizes the data spatially by using one of three approaches including local entropy, local spatial autocorrelation, and local distance-based outliers, to identify interesting spatial features in the dataset. Then, a location/time period matrix which is analogous to a term/document matrix in natural language processing is created to capture the spatial features for a given semantic time period. This matrix contains a count of for each spatial location, the number of times that it is a feature of interest during a semantic time period. Then using latent semantic analysis, the cosine similarity for each semantic time period is calculated. The results are then clustered using affinity propagation. The results show that the similarity matrix produced by distance-based outliers creates the best clustering. The approach is demonstrated on a modeled global climate dataset where we clustered years from 1948 to 2012.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: document term matrixlatent semantic analysissimilarityentropycorrelationtemperature measurementstressdata analysissemanticsdata scienceinformation retrievaldata miningmachine learningcomputer science

While various biclustering algorithms (e.g., combinatorial, probabilistic modelling, and matrix factorization) have been proposed and constantly improved in the past decade, data noise and bicluster overlaps make biclustering a still challenging task. It becomes difficult to further improve biclustering performance, without resorting to a new approach. Inspired by the recent progress in unsupervised feature learning using deep neural networks, in this work, we propose a novel model for biclustering, named Auto Decoder (AD), by relating biclusters to features and leveraging a neural network that is able to automatically learn features from the input data. To suppress severe noise present in gene expression data, we introduce a non-uniform signal recovery mechanism: Instead of reconstructing the whole input data to capture the bicluster patterns, AD weighs the zero and non-zero parts of the input data differently and is more flexible in dealing with different types of noise. AD is also properly regularized to deal with bicluster overlaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first biclustering algorithm that leverages neural network techniques to recover overlapped biclusters hidden in noisy gene expression data. We compared our approach with four state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. On three out of the four real datasets, AD significantly outperforms the other approaches. On controlled synthetic datasets, AD performs the best when noise level is beyond 15%.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: biclusteringunsupervised learningdata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningcomputer science

As the world's fourth largest disease, depression has become one of the most significant research subjects. Previously, a depression classifier has been proposed to classify the users in online social networks to be depressed or not, however, the classifier takes only node features into account and neglects the influence of linkages. This paper proposes an improved model to calculate the probability of a user being depressed, which is based on both node and linkage features. The linkage features are measured in two aspects: tie strength and interaction content analysis. Moreover, the propagation rule of depression is considered for improving the prediction accuracy. Finally, our experiments on the data derived from Sina Micro-blog shows that the highest accuracy of the improved model is 95%, increasing by 15% compared to the classifier with node features considered only. In this paper, it is well proved that adding linkage features analysis performs much better than node features analysis only.

Discovering and recognizing spatiotemporal objects (e.g., events) in such data is of paramount importance to the security and safety of facilities and individuals. Hierarchical feature learning is at the crux to the problems of discovery and recognition. We present a multilayered convergent neural architecture for storing repeating spatially and temporally coincident patterns in data at multiple levels of abstraction. The bottom-up weights in each layer are learned to encode a hierarchy of over complete and sparse feature dictionaries from space- and time-varying sensory data by recursive layer-by-layer spherical clustering. This density-based clustering algorithm ignores outliers by the use of a unique adaptive threshold in each neuron's transfer function. The model scales to full-sized high-dimensional input data and also to an arbitrary number of layers, thereby possessing the capability to capture features at any level of abstraction. It is fully-learnable with only two manually tunable parameters. The model was deployed to learn meaningful feature hierarchies from audio, images and videos which can then be used for recognition and reconstruction.

By proving that whitening is the optimal linear transformation to the Euclidean space in the sense of minimum log-determinant divergence, we propose a transformation model called class conditional decor relation (CCD). The objective of CCD is to diagonalize the covariance matrices of different classes simultaneously, which is efficiently optimized using a modified Jacobi method. CCD is effective to find the common principal components among multiple classes. After CCD, the variables become class conditionally uncorrelated, which will benefit the subsequent classification tasks. Combining CCD with the nearest class mean (NCM) classification model can significantly improve the classification accuracy.

Addressing this we present a novel quantizer based upon optimization of comparison fidelity and a computationally tractable algorithm for its implementation on big datasets. We demonstrate empirically that our new approach provides a statistically significant reduction in the amount of error introduced by the symbolization process compared to current state-of-the-art.

This type of data, which comprises electronic health records, shipment tracking data, and process logs, is well-suited to the tabular structure of standard database relations. The difficulty, however, is that temporal pattern matching queries (one of the most common types of queries over this type of data) are not well-suited to standard relational query processing. This difficulty is exacerbated when the question is not only whether an event record matches a given query, but how best to match the events in the record to the events in the query when multiple options are present. In this paper, we demonstrate that temporal pattern matching queries can be formulated and solved as integer programs. This novel approach has distinct advantages over standard query processing techniques in that it puts no ordering constraints on the underlying event record, and can easily discern between multiple possible solutions using the objective function. Additionally, these integer programs can be constructed incrementally, facilitating an easy translation between the query specification interface and the underlying execution instructions. We show that integer programs can capture a wide range of temporal pattern matching constructs, including intervals, absences, repetition, and flexibility, and provide new insights on both the strengths and drawbacks of implementing this processing strategy in practice.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: sargableweb query classificationspatial queryquery expansionquery optimizationformal specificationquery languagepattern matchinguser interfaceinteger programmingtheoretical computer sciencedata miningdatabasecomputer science

This paper proposes to recommend time-sensitive trip routes, consisting of a sequence of locations with associated time stamps, based on knowledge extracted from large-scale time-stamped location sequence data (e.g. check-ins and GPS traces). We argue a good route should consider (a) the popularity of places, (b) the visiting order of places, (c) the proper visiting time of each place, and (d) the proper transit time from one place to another. By devising a statistical model, we integrate these four factors into a route goodness function which aims to measure the quality of a route. Equipped with the route goodness, we recommend time-sensitive routes for two scenarios. The first is about constructing the route based on the user-specified source location with the starting time. The second is about composing the route between the specified source location and the destination location given a starting time. To handle these queries, we propose a search method, Guidance Search, which consists of a novel heuristic satisfaction function which guides the search towards the destination location, and a backward checking mechanism to boost the effectiveness of the constructed route.

Our goal is to build a learner framework that uses the current data and the knowledge from historical data to predict the next data in an efficient, unsupervised and online manner.

We present a learner model, called SELP, for learning in variances as features from explanations of surprises due to prediction errors in streaming spatiotemporal data. This model runs a relentless cycle of Surprise → Explain → Learn → Predict involving the real external world and its internal model. The learner is continuously updated, independent of a trigger, proportional to its surprise. It implements a more efficient version of predictive coding, a form of biologically-plausible information coding paradigm, by predicting changes in the data instead of the data itself.

Zombies Walk Among Us: Cross-Platform Data Mining for Event Monitoring,Emma L. Tonkin (King's College London)Heather D. Pfeiffer (New Mexico State University),"2487403303,2098020650","Social networks such as Facebook, Orkut and so on, are repositories of information that are viewed as users' opinions. However, data mining across multiple social websites can reveal valuable factual information for both monitoring and reconstructing events. Crowd sourcing can be used on these sites to monitor `flash mob' group behaviors, loosely or formally planned activities, such as `zombie walks'. In certain contexts, these walks are `marketed' to social site users in order to promote charitable or social engagements, in others, analysis suggests that participation is a form of political engagement. We use multi-platform information extraction to build an atlas of geographic and demographic events, which leads us to compelling, yet imperfect, understanding of why events are successful and regionally relevant factors that encourage people to pick up behaviors or participate in movements. More generally, this case study confirms that `big-data'-led analysis of this kind is reasonably straightforward and rewarding, as well as providing a useful basis for Bayesian reasoning: the use of available evidence to evaluate propositions about this type of events.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: social networkdata analysisbig datainternet privacyworld wide webdata miningmachine learningcomputer science
A Novel and Successful Credit Card Fraud Detection System Implemented in a Turkish Bank,Ekrem Duman (Özyeğin University)Ayse Buyukkaya (Salesforce.com)Ilker Elikucuk,"2230257874,2227560606,227750855","We developed a credit card fraud detection solution for a major bank in Turkey. The study was completed in about three years and the developed system has been in use since February 2013. It had a great impact in the rule based fraud detection process used by the bank. Indeed, while eighty percent of the rules have been eliminated and the number of alerts has been reduced to half, a significant increase in fraud detection has been recorded. As of now the system can catch ninety seven percent of fraud attempts online or, nearly online. The study is interesting in both the formulation of the problem and the algorithms implemented. In fact, we noticed that the standard classification algorithms are not fully suitable for the fraud detection problem (as the cost of every individual false negative can be different from the others), and we looked for alternative methods, especially the meta-heuristics. Among them the newly introduced migrating birds optimization algorithm (MBO) turned out to be superior and was implemented.

They allow to follow a target problem, with a constant adaptation to a dynamic environment. The drawback of using kernels in online settings is the continuous complexity growth, in terms of time and memory usage, experienced both in the learning and classification phases. In this paper, we extend a state-of-the-art Budgeted Online Learning Algorithm that efficiently constraints the overall complexity. We introduce the principles of Fairness and Weight Adjustment: the former mitigates the effect of unbalanced datasets, while the latter improves the stability of the resulting models. The usage of robust semantic kernel functions in Sentiment Analysis in Twitter improves the results with respect to the standard budgeted formulation.

Non-Euclidean Internet Coordinates Embedding,Alexander Allan (University of Reading)Ross Humphrey (University of Reading)Giuseppe Di Fatta (University of Reading),"2496594430,2231222236,2017982463","For many applications it is desirable to be able to estimate latency in a decentralised network when it is not practical to explicitly measure it. It has previously been shown that latency can be approximated by assigning hosts coordinates in some geometric space such that the Euclidean distance between two hosts in this space is equivalent to latency, a method known as a Network Coordinate (NC) system. This is commonly achieved by a large scale distributed optimisation which seeks to minimise the error between latency and Euclidean distance. In this work we challenge the assumption of Euclidean space as a satisfactory model for embedding Internet-like networks, due to the curved nature of network distances. We present a novel distributed optimisation methodology: Non-Euclidean Internet Coordinates Embedding (NICE). NICE uses a polynomial regression model to explicitly learn the most effective distance function for latency estimation within a geometric space, in addition to a distributed non linear dimensionality reduction method. Dimensionality reduction is achieved via a variant of Landmark Multi Dimensional Scaling (LMDS) and a distributed optimisation algorithm. This allows the distributed system to create a set of coordinates for each of the participating hosts that can be used to accurately estimate latency. The system is implemented within the Java based PeerSim network simulator using both real and artificially generated input topologies and then compared to two of the most widely implemented NC systems: GNP and Vivaldi. By experimental simulation we show that NICE is significantly more accurate than either method while still remaining robust in the face of real network conditions.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: economic indicatorjavamultidimensional scalingeuclidean distancenetwork topologyregressionaccuracy and precisionpolynomialthe internetregression analysisdistributed algorithmtheoretical computer sciencemachine learningmathematical optimizationstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

PerturBoost: Practical Confidential Classifier Learning in the Cloud,Keke Chen (Wright State University)Shumin Guo (Wright State University),"2125330238,2151028486","Mining large data requires intensive computing resources and data mining expertise, which might not be available for many users. With the development of cloud computing and services computing, data mining tasks can now be moved to the cloud or outsourced to third parties to save costs. In this new paradigm, data and model confidentiality becomes the major concern to the data owner. Meanwhile, users are also concerned about the potential tradeoff among costs, model quality, and confidentiality. In this paper, we propose the PerturBoost framework to address the problems in confidential cloud or outsourced learning. PerturBoost combined with the random space perturbation (RASP) method that was also developed by us can effectively protect data confidentiality, model confidentiality, and model quality with low client-side costs. Based on the boosting framework, we develop a number of base learner algorithms that can learn linear classifiers from the RASP-perturbed data. This approach has been evaluated with public datasets. The result shows that the RASP-based PerturBoost can provide model accuracy very close to the classifiers trained with the original data and the AdaBoost method, with high confidentiality guarantee and acceptable costs.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: activity based costingcloud computingdata sciencedata miningdatabasemachine learningcomputer science

This paper presents various host based anomaly detection techniques. One technique uses clustering with markov network (CMN). In CMN we first cluster the benign training data and then from each cluster we build a separate markov network to model the benign behavior. During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data.

Binary Time-Series Query Framework for Efficient Quantitative Trait Association Study,Hongfei Wang (Case Western Reserve University)Xiang Zhang (Case Western Reserve University),"2432476779,2553248206","Quantitative trait association study examines the association between quantitative traits and genetic variants. As a promising tool, it has been widely applied to dissect the genetic basis of complex diseases. However, such study usually involves testing trillions of variant-trait pairs and demands intensive computational resources. Recently, several algorithms have been developed to improve its efficiency. In this paper, we propose a framework, Fabrique, which models quantitative trait association study as querying binary time-series and bridges the two seemly different problems. Specifically, in the proposed framework, genetic variants are treated as a database consisting of binary time-series. Finding trait-associated variants is equivalent to finding the nearest neighbors of the trait. For efficient query process, Fabrique partitions and normalizes the binary time-series, and estimates a tight upper bound for each group of time-series to prune the search space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Fabrique only needs to search a very small portion of the database to locate the target variants and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method. We also show that Fabrique can be applied to other binary time-series query problem in addition to the genetic association study.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: time seriesbioinformaticsdata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

However, data quantity and availability is continuing to rapidly expand such that we no longer have fixed and manageable data sets, but rather continual streams of data. Mining streaming data becomes challenging when using a piece-wise or online approach, however, due to concept drift and feature evolution. As the stream progresses, features may be added, removed, or change in the range of possible values, which is known as feature evolution. The defining concepts for a label or class may also migrate over the span of the data stream. Novel classes that were not known a priori can also appear within the data stream. Traditional algorithms often characterize unknown labels as errors and outliers, but in the dynamic streaming domain, a sufficiently dense cluster of outliers must be analyzed to discover potential emergent classes. In our approach, we aim to adapt to novel classes emergence, feature evolution, and concept drift while labeling data instances and adhering to the constraints of continuous data streams. Our solution consists of an adaptive supervised ensemble for predicting instance labels, and a stream clustering approach to monitor concept defining characteristics and novel class development without regard to label (i.e. unsupervised).

Dissimilarity Features in Recommender Systems,Christos Zigkolis (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki)Savvas Karagiannidis (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki)Athena Vakali (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki),"2303423136,2042962031,2045559396","In the context of recommenders, providing suitable suggestions requires an effective content analysis where information for items, in the form of features, can play a significant role. Many recommenders suffer from the absence of indicative features capable of capturing precisely the users' preferences which constitutes a vital requirement for a successful recommendation technique. Aiming to overcome such limitations, we introduce a framework through which we extract dissimilarity features based on differences in preferences of items' attributes among users. We enrich the representations of items with the extracted features for the purpose of increasing the ability of a recommender to highlight the preferred items. In this direction, we incorporate the dissimilarity features into different types of classifiers/recommenders (C4.5 and lib-SVM) and evaluate their importance in terms of precision and relevance.

In this paper, we introduce a maximum entropy classification method with feature selection for large dimensional data such as text datasets that is generative in nature. To tackle the curse of dimensionality of large data sets, we employ conditional independence assumption (Naive Bayes) and we perform feature selection simultaneously, by enforcing a 'maximum discrimination' between estimated class conditional densities. For two class problems, in the proposed method, we use Jeffreys (J) divergence to discriminate the class conditional densities. To extend our method to the multi-class case, we propose a completely new approach by considering a multi-distribution divergence: we replace Jeffreys divergence by Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence to discriminate conditional densities of multiple classes. In order to reduce computational complexity, we employ a modified Jensen-Shannon divergence (JS_GM), based on AM-GM inequality. We show that the resulting divergence is a natural generalization of Jeffreys divergence to a multiple distributions case. As far as the theoretical justifications are concerned we show that when one intends to select the best features in a generative maximum entropy approach, maximum discrimination using J-divergence emerges naturally in binary classification.

The analysis of such data is particularly complex not only due to its massive size but also due to its heterogeneity and inherent noise associated with several data gathering steps. The utilization of biological networks to model and integrate large-scale heterogeneous biomedical data continues to grow, especially with the systems biology approach taking center stage in many bioinformatics applications. Although loaded with biologically relevant signals, correlation networks do contain noise and are too large for simple data mining tools. In this project, we implement different types of filters to reduce the network size and sort out signals from noise. We propose a new approach for generating various filters that iterate on sub graphs along a spectrum between spanning tree and chordal filters. We show how different network filters incrementally obtain various clusters along this spectrum to maintain structural and domain-relevant components of the original network, while reducing noise. We test the proposed approach using gene expression levels obtained from diabetes and yeast datasets and compare the filtered networks with original networks using ontology enrichment. The obtained results support our main hypothesis that the filters conserve important elements from the original networks while uncovering new biologically significant clusters. However, results analyzing maintained and uncovered biologically significant hubs were inconclusive.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: ontologycorrelationiterative methodnoisegene expressiondata analysissystems biologygraph theorybioinformaticsdata miningmachine learningcomputer sciencemathematics

While it is generally agreed that application specific human assessment can provide a reasonable gold standard for clustering evaluation, the use of human assessors is not practical in many real situations. As a result, machine computable internal clustering quality measures (CQMs) are often used in the evaluation process. However, CQMs have their own drawbacks. Despite their extensive use in clustering research and applications, many CQMs have been shown to lack generality. In this paper we present a new CQM with general applicability. The basis of our CQM is a pattern recognition view of clustering's purpose: the unsupervised prediction of behavior from populations. This purpose translates naturally into our new classifier based CQM which we refer to as in formativeness. We show that in formativeness can satisfy core CQM axioms defined in prior research.

This extension avoids the global optimization for irrelevant pairwise constraints and can thus maximize the discriminative information in each local area.

A Tolerance Graph Approach for Domain-Specific Assembly of Next Generation Sequencing Data,Julia Warnke (University of Nebraska Omaha)Hesham H. Ali (University of Nebraska Omaha),"2053908444,2161492394","Next generation sequencing (NGS) has become a major focus in many recent biological research applications. NGS produces thousands to millions of short DNA fragments in a single run. Individually, these fragments represent only a small fraction of an original biological sample. To obtain any useful information, overlapping fragments must be assembled into long stretches of contiguous sequence. Various assemblers have been developed to address the fragment assembly problem. The majority of current assemblers were developed to fill an important gap, however, they were developed with a pure computational focus without taking the properties of the input datasets into consideration. NGS dataset characteristics such as fragment coverage and underlying genome complexity vary dramatically between different sequencing applications. Generic assemblers that are data independent are unlikely to produce accurate solutions in all problem domains. In this study, we propose a graph theoretic approach based on the concept of tolerance graphs to develop a domain-specific assembler. The proposed assembler is designed to extract signals associated with local features in the input dataset and reintegrate this knowledge into the assembly process through customized tolerance graph parameters. We conducted a number of experiments to study the impact of various input parameters on the quality of the assembled genomes. Results from this study show that the proposed assembler produces excellent results and outperforms other known assembly algorithms for some input datasets. This approach also presents the foundation for developing domain-specific assemblers to be applied in an intelligent and customized manner to a wide variety of input instances, resulting in more efficient assembly tactics and improved overall assembly quality.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: assemblysequential analysisgroup method of data handlingfeature extractiondna sequencingdnamathematical modelgenomicsgraph theorytheoretical computer sciencebioinformaticsdata miningmachine learningstatisticscomputer sciencemathematics

Modeling Preferences with Availability Constraints,Bing Tian DaiHady Wirawan Lauw (Singapore Management University),"2690657696,2024254804","User preferences are commonly learned from historical data whereby users express preferences for items, e.g., through consumption of products or services. Most work assumes that a user is not constrained in their selection of items. This assumption does not take into account the availability constraint, whereby users could only access some items, but not others. For example, in subscription-based systems, we can observe only those historical preferences on subscribed (available) items. However, the objective is to predict preferences on unsubscribed (unavailable) items, which do not appear in the historical observations due to their (lack of) availability. To model preferences in a probabilistic manner and address the issue of availability constraint, we develop a graphical model, called Latent Transition Model (LTM) to discover users' latent interests. LTM is novel in incorporating transitions in interests when certain items are not available to the user. Experiments on a real-life implicit feedback dataset demonstrate that LTM is effective in discovering customers' latent interests, and it achieves significant improvements in prediction accuracy over baselines that do not model transitions.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: topic modelgraphical modelgroup method of data handlingprobabilityconsumer behaviourdata sciencedata miningdatabasemachine learningcomputer science

Identifying important features/parts of these networks for a multitude of applications is becoming increasingly significant as the need for big data analysis techniques grows. When analyzing a network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), identifying nodes of significant importance can direct the user toward biologically relevant network features. In this work, we propose that a node of structural importance in a network model can correspond to a biologically vital or significant property. This relationship between topological and biological importance can be seen in/between structurally defined nodes, such as hub nodes and driver nodes, within a network and within clusters. This work proposes data mining approaches for identification and examination of relationships between hub and driver nodes within human, yeast, rat, and mouse PPI networks. Relationships with other types of significant nodes, with direct neighbors, and with the rest of the network were analyzed to determine if the model can be characterized biologically by its structural makeup. We performed numerous tests on structure with a data-driven mentality, looking for properties that were potentially significant on a network level and then comparing those properties to biological significance. Our results showed that identifying and cross-referencing different types of topologically significant nodes can exemplify properties such as transcription factor enrichment, lethality, clustering, and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.

In this article, we bridge the gap between the l 0 constraint and the l 1 constraint through development of two new sparse clustering models, which are the sparse k-means with the l q (0 0 constraint. By proving the certain forms of the optimal solution of particular l q (0 = q q (0 = q 1 constraint.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: hybrid algorithmbinary constraintconstrained clusteringconstraint graphiterative methoddata miningpattern recognitionmachine learningmathematical optimizationmathematics

One area that has attracted considerable amounts of research in recent years is that of green customer behavior. However, the approaches used have often been static clustering approaches and have focused on identifying green vs. non-green customers. In fact, results have been non-unanimous and not seldom contradictory. An alternative approach is to study customers according to degrees of green purchases. Recently, a Self-Organizing Time Map (SOTM) over any variable of cardinal, ordinal or higher level of measurement has been proposed. The key idea is to enable the exploration of changes in cluster structures over not only the time dimension, but also any other variable. This paper presents an application of the SOTM to demographic and behavioral customer data, in which the key focus is on assessing how customer behavior varies over customers' degree of greenness.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: customer intelligencevoice of the customercluster analysisvisual analyticsbehavioural sciencesmachine learningcomputer science

The homomorphic encryption is an ideal way to protect users' privacy in cloud computing. But some of the existing homomorphic encryption schemes have less usability, and some are inefficient. There lacks of practical homomorphic encryption schemes in cloud computing at present. CESVMC is a scheme supposed to solve the problem. CESVMC ensures that after calculating the user's encrypted data and returning the cipher result to user by the service provider, the user can decrypt the cipher result and get the right service result. But CESVMC only supports multiplication or division operation once. Meanwhile, to decrypt the cipher text, user needs to tell which type of operation has been done to the cipher text. All these constrain the usability of CESVMC in cloud computing. To solve these problems, an improved CESVMC (ICDM) is proposed. In encryption algorithm, the information of plaintext and the operation type are hidden in a diagonal matrix. Then the diagonal matrix is encrypted by using an invertible matrix as secret key. In decryption algorithm, ICDM chooses the right encryption method by reading the sign of the operation type without any manual interventions. Besides, the arithmetic operations on cipher text correspond to the arithmetic operations on matrix. Security analysis indicates ICDM is IND-CPA. And the experiments show ICDM can support unlimited times arithmetic operations homomorphically after partly lowering efficiency and adding the cipher text length. Thus, it can fit privacy-preserving in cloud computing better.",2013,Computational Science and Engineering,Fields of study: homomorphic secret sharingclient side encryptionon the fly encryptiondiagonal matrixencryptioncloud computingcryptographyinformation privacytheoretical computer scienceinternet privacyoperating systemcomputer securitycomputer science

Data mining application for cyber credit-card fraud detection system,John Akhilomen (University of Derby),2287795519,"Since the evolution of the internet, many small and large companies have moved their businesses to the internet to provide services to customers worldwide. Cyber credit card fraud or no card present fraud is increasingly rampant in the recent years for the reason that the credit card is majorly used to request payments by these companies on the internet. Therefore the need to ensure secured transactions for credit-card owners when consuming their credit cards to make electronic payments for goods and services provided on the internet is a criterion. Data mining has popularly gained recognition in combating cyber credit-card fraud because of its effective artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and algorithms that can be implemented to detect or predict fraud through Knowledge Discovery from unusual patterns derived from gathered data. In this study, a system's model for cyber credit card fraud detection is discussed and designed. This system implements the supervised anomaly detection algorithm of Data mining to detect fraud in a real time transaction on the internet, and thereby classifying the transaction as legitimate, suspicious fraud and illegitimate transaction. The anomaly detection algorithm is designed on the Neural Networks which implements the working principal of the human brain (as we humans learns from past experience and then make our present day decisions on what we have learned from our past experience). To understand how cyber credit card fraud are being committed, in this study the different types of cyber fraudsters that commit cyber credit card fraud and the techniques used by these cyber fraudsters to commit fraud on the internet is discussed.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: merchant plug inconstructive fraudcomputer fraudclick fraudartificial neural networkinternet privacycomputer securitydata miningmachine learningcomputer science

In order to find such co-occurring patterns we apply closed itemset-mining augmented with item cost information and build corresponding association rules with risk information. Such rules can be used by project managers of SO contracts to minimize the gap between the proposed and implemented solutions. In experiments, conducted on a sample of deals of a multi-national SO provider, we show the applicability of the framework for predicting significant cost-overruns.

Mining floating train data sequences for temporal association rules within a predictive maintenance framework,Wissam Sammouri (IFSTTAR)Etienne Côme (IFSTTAR)Latifa Oukhellou (IFSTTAR)Patrice Aknin (IFSTTAR),"2057164065,2617752151,2003561032,1999068288","In order to meet the mounting social and economic demands, railway operators and manufacturers are striving for a longer availability and a better reliability of railway transportation systems. Commercial trains are being equipped with state-of-the-art onboard intelligent sensors monitoring various subsystems all over the train. These sensors provide real-time spatio-temporal data consisting of georeferenced timestamped events that tend sometimes to occur in bursts. Once ordered with respect to time, these events can be considered as long temporal sequences that can be mined for possible relationships leading to association rules. In this paper, we propose a methodology for discovering association rules in very bursty and challenging floating train data sequences with multiple constraints. This methodology is based on using null models to discover significant co-occurrences between pairs of events. Once identified and scrutinized by various metrics, these co-occurrences are then used to derive temporal association rules that can predict the imminent arrival of severe failures. Experiments performed on Alstom's TrainTracerTM data show encouraging results.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: association rule learningdata miningmachine learningsimulationcomputer science

Traditional Fleet Management Systems are gradually extended with new features to improve reliability, such as better maintenance planning. Typical diagnostic and predictive maintenance methods require extensive experimentation and modelling during development. This is unfeasible if the complete vehicle is addressed as it would require too much engineering resources.This thesis investigates unsupervised and supervised methods for predicting vehicle maintenance. The methods are data driven and use extensive amounts of data, either streamed, on-board data or historic and aggregated data from off-board databases. The methods rely on a telematics gateway that enables vehicles to communicate with a back-office system. Data representations, either aggregations or models, are sent wirelessly to an off-board system which analyses the data for deviations. These are later associated to the repair history and form a knowledge base that can be used to predict upcoming failures on other vehicles that show the same deviations.The thesis further investigates different ways of doing data representations and deviation detection. The first one presented, COSMO, is an unsupervised and self-organised approach demonstrated on a fleet of city buses. It automatically comes up with the most interesting on-board data representations and uses a consensus based approach to isolate the deviating vehicle. The second approach outlined is a super-vised classification based on earlier collected and aggregated vehicle statistics in which the repair history is used to label the usage statistics. A classifier is trained to learn patterns in the usage data that precede specific repairs and thus can be used to predict vehicle maintenance. This method is demonstrated for failures of the vehicle air compressor and based on AB Volvo’s database of vehicle usage statistics.",2013,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: vehicle tracking systemdata miningmachine learningsimulationcomputer science

This multi-dimensional source of data offers new possibilities to tackle established research problems on human mobility, but it also opens avenues for the development of novel mobile applications and services. In this work we study the problem of predicting the next venue a mobile user will visit, by exploring the predictive power offered by different facets of user behavior. We first analyze about 35 million check-ins made by about 1 million Foursquare users in over 5 million venues across the globe, spanning a period of five months. We then propose a set of features that aim to capture the factors that may drive users' movements. Our features exploit information on transitions between types of places, mobility flows between venues, and spatio-temporal characteristics of user check-in patterns. We further extend our study combining all individual features in two supervised learning models, based on linear regression and M5 model trees, resulting in a higher overall prediction accuracy. We find that the supervised methodology based on the combination of multiple features offers the highest levels of prediction accuracy: M5 model trees are able to rank in the top fifty venues one in two user check-ins, amongst thousands of candidate items in the prediction list.",2012,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: location based servicemobility modeluser interfaceregression analysisdata scienceworld wide webdata miningmachine learningcomputer science
IRIE: Scalable and Robust Influence Maximization in Social Networks,Kyomin Jung (KAIST)Wooram Heo (KAIST)Wei Chen (Microsoft),"2304483808,2223541506,2527738285","Influence maximization is the problem of selecting top $k$ seed nodes in a social network to maximize their influence coverage under certain influence diffusion models.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that IRIE matches the influence coverage of other algorithms while scales much better than all other algorithms. Moreover IRIE is much more robust and stable than other algorithms both in running time and memory usage for various density of networks and cascade size. It runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms such as PMIA for large networks with tens of millions of nodes and edges, while using only a fraction of memory.",2012,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: viral marketingsocial network analysissocial sciencedata miningartificial intelligencemachine learningcomputer science
Scalable Coordinate Descent Approaches to Parallel Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems,Hsiang-Fu Yu (University of Texas at Austin)Cho-Jui Hsieh (University of Texas at Austin)Si Si (University of Texas at Austin)Inderjit S. Dhillon (University of Texas at Austin),"2149528706,2148022289,2099379656,2033403132","Matrix factorization, when the matrix has missing values, has become one of the leading techniques for recommender systems. To handle web-scale datasets with millions of users and billions of ratings, scalability becomes an important issue. Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are two popular approaches to compute matrix factorization. There has been a recent flurry of activity to parallelize these algorithms. However, due to the cubic time complexity in the target rank, ALS is not scalable to large-scale datasets. On the other hand, SGD conducts efficient updates but usually suffers from slow convergence that is sensitive to the parameters. Coordinate descent, a classical optimization approach, has been used for many other large-scale problems, but its application to matrix factorization for recommender systems has not been explored thoroughly. In this paper, we show that coordinate descent based methods have a more efficient update rule compared to ALS, and are faster and have more stable convergence than SGD. We study different update sequences and propose the CCD++ algorithm, which updatesrank-one factors one by one. In addition, CCD++ can be easily parallelized on both multi-core and distributed systems. We empirically show that CCD++ is much faster than ALS and SGD in both settings. As an example, on a synthetic dataset with 2 billion ratings, CCD++ is 4 times faster than both SGD and ALS using a distributed system with 20 machines.",2012,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: matrix decompositionstochastic processtheoretical computer sciencedata miningmachine learningmathematical optimizationcomputer sciencemathematics
