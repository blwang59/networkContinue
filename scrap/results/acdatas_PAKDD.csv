Query-based Music Recommendations via Preference Embedding,Chih-Ming Chen (National Chengchi University);Ming-Feng Tsai (National Chengchi University);Yu-Ching Lin (National Taiwan University);Yi-Hsuan Yang (Academia Sinica);,"2660913183,2166008087,2116887728,2127109347","A common scenario considered in recommender systems is to predict a user's preferences on unseen items based on his/her preferences on observed items. A major limitation of this scenario is that a user might be interested in different things each time when using the system, but there is no way to allow the user to actively alter or adjust the recommended results. To address this issue, we propose the idea of ""query-based recommendation"" that allows a user to specify his/her search intention while exploring new items, thereby incorporating the concept of information retrieval into recommendation systems. Moreover, the idea is more desirable when the user intention can be expressed in different ways. Take music recommendation as an example: the proposed system allows a user to explore new song tracks by specifying either a track, an album, or an artist. To enable such heterogeneous queries in a recommender system, we present a novel technique called ""Heterogeneous Preference Embedding"" to encode user preference and query intention into low-dimensional vector spaces. Then, with simple search methods or similarity calculations, we can use the encoded representation of queries to generate recommendations. This method is fairly flexible and it is easy to add other types of information when available. Evaluations on three music listening datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art matrix factorization and network embedding methods.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

This problem affects our everyday experience while searching for knowledge on a topic. Naive Collaborative Filtering cannot deal with challenging issues such as scalability, noise, and sparsity. We can deal with all the aforementioned challenges by applying matrix and tensor decomposition methods. These methods have been proven to be the most accurate (i.e., Netflix prize) and efficient for handling big data. For each method (SVD, SVD++, timeSVD++, HOSVD, CUR, etc.) we will provide a detailed theoretical mathematical background and a step-by-step analysis, by using an integrated toy example, which runs throughout all parts of the tutorial, helping the audience to understand clearly the differences among factorisation methods.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,matrix decomposition;recommender system;data science;theoretical computer science;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

Normally a descent conversational agent for a particular domain requires tens of thousands of hand labeled conversational data or hand written rules.

Here we explore extensions in the direction of adaptive personalization and item diversification within Stream, a new form of visual browsing and discovery by Amazon. Our system presents the user with a diverse set of interesting items while adapting to user interactions. Our solution consists of three components (1) a Bayesian regression model for scoring the relevance of items while leveraging uncertainty, (2) a submodular diversification framework that re-ranks the top scoring items based on category, and (3) personalized category preferences learned from the user's behavior.

Discovering What You're Known For: A Contextual Poisson Factorization Approach,Haokai Lu (Texas A&M University);James Caverlee (Texas A&M University);Wei Niu (Texas A&M University);,"2305711674,2028974103,2232381592","Discovering what people are known for is valuable to many important applications such as recommender systems. Unlike an individual's personal interests, what a user is known for is reflected by the views of others, and is often not easily discerned for a long-tail of the vast majority of users. In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering what users are known for through a probabilistic model called Bayesian Contextual Poisson Factorization. Moving beyond just modeling user's content, it naturally models and integrates additional contextual factors, concretely, user's geo-spatial footprints and social influence, to overcome noisy online activities and social relations. Through GPS-tagged social media datasets, we find that the proposed method can improve known-for prediction performance by 17.5% in precision and 20.9% in recall on average, and that it can capture the implicit relationships between a user's known-for profile and her content, geo-spatial and social influence.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,multimedia;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Mendeley: Recommendations for Researchers,Saúl Vargas (Autonomous University of Madrid);Maya Hristakeva;Kris Jack;,"2149080843,33023586,2174908572","For a researcher, keeping up with what is going on in their research field can be a difficult and time-consuming task. For example, a fresh PhD student may want to know what are the relevant papers matching their research interests. An assistant professor may like to be up-to-date with what their colleagues are publishing. A professor might want to be notified about funding opportunities relevant to the work done in their research group. Since the volume of published research and research activity is constantly growing, it is becoming increasingly more difficult for researchers to be able to manage and filter through the research information flow. In this challenging context, Mendeley's mission is to become the world's ""research operating system"". We do this not only by providing our well-know reference management system, but also by providing discovery capabilities for researchers on different kinds of entities, such as articles and profiles. In our talk, we will share Mendeley's experiences with building our article and profile recommendation systems, the challenges that we have faced and the solutions that we have put in place.

Human-Recommender Systems: From Benchmark Data to Benchmark Cognitive Models,Patrick Shafto (Rutgers–Newark);Olfa Nasraoui (University of Louisville);,"2719043774,260981774","We bring to the fore of the recommender system research community, an inconvenient truth about the current state of understanding how recommender system algorithms and humans influence one another, both computationally and cognitively. Unlike the great variety of supervised machine learning algorithms which traditionally rely on expert input labels and are typically used for decision making by an expert, recommender systems specifically rely on data input from non-expert or casual users and are meant to be used directly by these same non-expert users on an every day basis. Furthermore, the advances in online machine learning, data generation, and predictive model learning have become increasingly interdependent, such that each one feeds on the other in an iterative cycle. Research in psychology suggests that people's choices are (1) contextually dependent, and (2) dependent on interaction history. Thus, while standard methods of training and assessing performance of recommender systems rely on benchmark datasets, we suggest that a critical step in the evolution of recommender systems is the development of benchmark models of human behavior that capture contextual and dynamic aspects of human behavior. It is important to emphasize that even extensive real life user-tests may not be sufficient to make up for this gap in benchmarking validity because user tests are typically done with either a focus on user satisfaction or engagement (clicks, sales, likes, etc) with whatever the recommender algorithm suggests to the user, and thus ignore the human cognitive aspect. We conclude by highlighting the interdisciplinary implications of this endeavor.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,recommender system;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

The methodology is based on building a graph in which the items liked by a user are connected to the items recommended through the properties available in the LOD cloud. Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations.

Recent approaches have tackled this issue introducing complex models to be learned offline, making them unable to deal with new items; on the contrary, we propose a group recommender able to manage new items too. In more detail, our technique determines the preference of a group for an item by combining the individual preferences of the group members on the basis of their contextual influence, where the contextual influence represents the ability of an individual, in a given situation, to direct the group's decision.

Addressing Cold Start for Next-song Recommendation,Szu-Yu Chou (Academia Sinica);Yi-Hsuan Yang (Academia Sinica);Jyh-Shing Roger Jang (National Taiwan University);Yu-Ching Lin (National Taiwan University);,"2492702683,2127109347,2663119428,2116887728","The cold start problem arises in various recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a tensor factorization-based algorithm that exploits content features extracted from music audio to deal with the cold start problem for the emerging application next-song recommendation. Specifically, the new algorithm learns sequential behavior to predict the next song that a user would be interested in based on the last song the user just listened to. A unique characteristic of the algorithm is that it learns and updates the mapping between the audio feature space and the item latent space each time during the iterations of the factorization process. This way, the content features can be better exploited in forming the latent features for both users and items, leading to more effective solutions for cold-start recommendation. Evaluation on a large-scale music recommendation dataset shows that the recommendation result of the proposed algorithm exhibits not only higher accuracy but also better novelty and diversity, suggesting its applicability in helping a user explore new items in next-item recommendation.

Joint User Modeling across Aligned Heterogeneous Sites,Xuezhi Cao (Shanghai Jiao Tong University);Yong Yu (Shanghai Jiao Tong University);,"2630810608,2119244895","An accurate and comprehensive user modeling technique is crucial for the quality of recommender systems. Traditionally, we model user preferences using only actions from the target site and may suffer from cold-start problem. As nowadays people normally engage in multiple online sites for various needs, we consider leveraging the cross-site actions to improve the user modeling accuracy. Specifically, in this paper we aim at achieving a more comprehensive and accurate user modeling by modeling user's actions in multiple aligned heterogeneous sites simultaneously. To do so, we propose a modularized probabilistic graphical model framework JUMA. We further integrate topic model and matrix factorization into JUMA for joint user modeling over text-based and item-based sites. We assemble and publish large-scale dataset for comprehensive analyzing and evaluation. Experimental results show that our framework JUMA out performs traditional within-site user modeling techniques, especially for cold-start scenarios. For cold-start users, we achieve relative improvements of 9.3% and 12.8% comparing to existing within-site approaches for recommendation in item-based and text-based sites respectively.

Comparing the methods in terms of item ranking accuracy, diversity and catalog coverage, we show that cross-domain preference data is useful to provide more accurate suggestions when user feedback in the target domain is scarce or not available at all, and may lead to more diverse recommendations depending on the target domain.

We propose Multi-feedback Bayesian Personalized Ranking (MF-BPR), a pairwise method that exploits different types of feedback with an extended sampling method. The feedback types are drawn from different ""channels"", in which users interact with items (e.g., clicks, likes, listens, follows, and purchases). We build on the insight that different kinds of feedback, e.g., a click versus a like, reflect different levels of commitment or preference. Our approach differs from previous work in that it exploits multiple sources of feedback simultaneously during the training process. The novelty of MF-BPR is an extended sampling method that equates feedback sources with ""levels"" that reflect the expected contribution of the signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments carried out on three datasets containing multiple types of feedback. Our experimental results demonstrate that with a right sampling method, MF-BPR outperforms BPR in terms of accuracy. We find that the advantage of MF-BPR lies in its ability to leverage level information when sampling negative items.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Bloomberg, renowned for its products in the financial world, has a very strong presence in the news and media industry. Bloomberg Media, on an average, publishes 400-500 stories and videos per day and we have close to 30 million unique visitors on our websites and mobile applications every month consuming this content. At such a scale it is very important to recommend relevant information for a good user experience. Recommendations in the News and Media domain bring a unique set of challenges due to the dynamic nature of the data as well as unique consumption patterns. The biggest challenge with building recommendation systems in the News domain is the dynamic nature of the domain itself; new content is published every few minutes and majority of the content has a short shelf life, i.e., the news is not relevant to users after a certain time span and the time span is generally of the order of hours rather than days, making it important to deliver relevant content in a timely manner. Moreover, our users consume content differently based on time of day. For example, some users whose focus is market news and market data during the day consume more long form and generic articles and videos in the evening. User preferences, along with being cyclical in nature, tend to change over time, so algorithms need to adapt to the changing taste of the user. In addition, we need to ensure that the users do get their share of important/trending news and are not put into a filter bubble.

The recommendation process is based only on user activity within a single session, defined as a sequence of events. This information is incorporated in the recommendation process by explicit context modeling with factorization methods and a novel approach with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

We propose a Two Stage MF approach so MF is run twice over the whole matrix; the first stage uses MF to generate a small percentage of pseudotransactions that are added to the original matrix to increase its density, and the second stage re-runs MF over this denser matrix to predict the user-item transactions in the testing set.

Both the operation and the evaluation of recommender system applications are most often driven by analyzing the behavior of users. In this paper, we argue that listening to what users say about the items and recommendations they like, the control they wish to exert on the output, and the ways in which they perceive the system and not just observing what they do will enable important developments in the future of recommender systems. We provide both philosophical and pragmatic motivations for this idea, describe the various points in the recommendation and evaluation processes where explicit user input may be considered, and discuss benefits that may result from considered incorporation of user preferences at each of these points. In particular, we envision recommender applications that aim to support users' better selves: helping them live the life that they desire to lead. For example, recommender-assisted behavior change requires algorithms to predict not what users choose or do now, inferable from behavioral data, but what they should choose or do in the future to become healthier, fitter, more sustainable, or culturally aware.

Increasing the Trustworthiness of Recommendations by Exploiting Social Media Sources,Catalin-Mihai Barbu (University of Duisburg-Essen);,2533398733,"Current recommender systems mostly do not take into account as well as they might the wealth of information available in social media, thus preventing the user from obtaining a broad and reliable overview of different opinions and ratings on a product. Furthermore, there is a lack of user control over the recommendation process-which is mostly fully automated and does not allow the user to influence the sources and mechanisms by which recommendations are produced-as well as over the presentation of recommended items. Consequently, recommendations are often not transparent to the user, are considered to be less trustworthy, or do not meet the user's situational needs. This work will investigate the theoretical foundations for user-controllable, interactive methods of recommending, will develop techniques that exploit social media data in conjunction with other sources, and will validate the research empirically in the area of e-commerce product recommendations. The methods developed are intended to be applicable in a wide range of recommending and decision support scenarios.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,trustworthy computing;user interface;recommender system;knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

We will focus on such applications from an information retrieval perspective. Information recommendation then takes the form of biasing information retrieval, in response to a query or, in the limit, in a query-less application.

The Exploit-Explore Dilemma in Music Recommendation,Oscar Celma (Pompeu Fabra University);,485547008,"Were The Rolling Stones right when they said, ""You can't always get what you want; but if you try sometime you get what you need""? Recommendation systems are the crystal ball of the Internet: predicting user intentions, making sense of big data, and delivering what people are looking for before they even know they want it. Pandora radio is best known for the Music Genome Project; the most unique and richly labeled music catalog of 1.5 million+ tracks. While this content-based approach to music recommendation is extremely effective and still used today as the foundation to the leading online radio service, Pandora has also collected more than a decade of contextual listener feedback in the form of more than 65 billion thumbs from 79M+ monthly active users who have created more than 9 billion stations. This session will look at how the interdisciplinary team at Pandora goes about making sense of these massive data sets to successfully make large scale music recommendations to our listeners. As opposed to more traditional recommender systems which need only to recommend a single item or set of items, Pandora's recommenders must provide an evolving set of sequential items, which constantly keep the experience new and exciting. In this talk I will present a dynamic ensemble learning system that combines musicological data and machine learning models to provide a truly personalized experience. This approach allows us to switch from a lean back experience (exploitation) to a more exploration mode to discover new music tailored specifically to users individual tastes. To exemplify this, I will present a recently launched product led by the research team, Thumbprint Radio. Following this session the audience will have an in-depth understanding of how Pandora uses science to determine the perfect balance of familiarity, discovery, repetition and relevance for each individual listener, measures and evaluates user satisfaction, and how our online and offline architecture stack plays a critical role in our success.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,ensemble learning;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;simulation;computer science;
Fifty Shades of Ratings: How to Benefit from a Negative Feedback in Top-N Recommendations Tasks,Evgeny Frolov (Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology);Ivan V. Oseledets (Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology);,"2148776492,2291227085","Conventional collaborative filtering techniques treat a top-n recommendations problem as a task of generating a list of the most relevant items. This formulation, however, disregards an opposite -- avoiding recommendations with completely irrelevant items. Due to that bias, standard algorithms, as well as commonly used evaluation metrics, become insensitive to negative feedback. In order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for sensitivity to a negative feedback. Our model achieves state-of-the-art quality in standard recommendation tasks while significantly outperforming other methods in the cold-start ""no-positive-feedback"" scenarios.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,cold start;collaborative filtering;recommender system;data mining;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient graph-based approach for collaborative filtering based on short-path enumeration. Moreover, we propose three scoring functions based on the Bayesian paradigm that effectively exploit distributional aspects of the users' ratings. We experiment with seven publicly available datasets against state-of-the-art graph-based and matrix factorization approaches.

Traditionally, movie recommender systems apply user-based collaborative filtering providing high quality recommendations if users maintain user profiles describing preferences and movie ratings. The shortcomings of Collaborative Filtering are that comprehensive user profiles are required and users tend to get recommendations very similar to the user profile ""filter bubble"". In addition, CF-based recommenders neither consider current trends nor the context. In order to overcome these weaknesses, we develop a system identifying interesting events in the stream of current news and deploying this information for computing recommendations.

To get an insight into real-world recommendation engines, we survey more than 30 existing shopping cart solutions and compare the performance of popular recommendation algorithms on proprietary e-commerce datasets. Our results show that deployed systems rarely go beyond trivial ""best seller"" lists or very basic personalized recommendation algorithms, which nevertheless exhibit superior performance to more elaborate techniques both in our experiments and other related studies. We also perform chronological dataset splits to demonstrate the importance of preserving the sequence of events during evaluation, and the recency of events during training.

The main idea of this approach is to distribute the user-rating matrix across different machines, each having access only to a part of the information, and to asynchronously propagate the updates of the stochastic gradient optimization across the network. Each time a machine receives a parameter vector, it averages its current parameter vector with the received one, and continues its iterations from this new point. Additionally, we introduce a similarity based regularization that constrains the user and item factors to be close to the average factors of their similar users and items found on subparts of the distributed user-rating matrix. We analyze the impact of the regularization terms on MovieLens (100K, 1M, 10M) and NetFlix datasets and show that it leads to a more efficient matrix factorization in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and that the asynchronous distributed approach significantly improves in convergence time as compared to an equivalent synchronous distributed approach.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;recommender system;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;

The question lies in how to appropriately incorporate social network into the architecture of RBM-based models for learning representations of preferences. In this paper, we propose two potential architectures: one that models social network among users as additional observations, and another that incorporates social network into the sharing of hidden units among related users.

Proactive Recommendation Delivery,Adem Sabic (Adria Airways);,2532832451,"The main purpose of Recommender Systems is to minimize the effects of information/choice overload. Recommendations are usually prepared based on the estimation of what would be useful or interesting to users. Thus, it is important that they are relevant to users, whether to their information needs, current activity or emotional state. This requires deep understanding of users' context but also the knowledge of the history of previous users' interactions within the system (e.g. clicks, views, etc.). But even when the recommendations are highly relevant, their delivery to users can be very problematic. Many existing systems require active user participation (explicit interaction with the recommender system) and attention. Or, on other side of spectrum, there are RS that handle recommendation delivery without any consideration for users' preferences of when, where or how the recommendations are being delivered. Proactive Recommender Systems promise a more autonomous approach for recommendation delivery, by anticipating information needs in advance and acting on users' behalf with minimal efforts and without disturbance.

Recommending for the World,Justin Basilico (Netflix);Yves Raimond (Netflix);,"2425211913,2535590686","The Netflix experience is driven by a number of recommendation algorithms: personalized ranking, page generation, similarity, ratings, search, etc. On the January 6th, 2016 we simultaneously launched Netflix in 130 new countries around the world, which brought the total to over 190 countries. Preparing for such a rapid expansion while ensuring each algorithm was ready to work seamlessly created new challenges for our recommendation and search teams. In this talk, we will highlight the four most interesting challenges we encountered in making our algorithms operate globally and how this improved our ability to connect members worldwide with stories they'll love. In particular, we will dive into the problems of uneven availability across catalogs, balancing personal and cultural tastes, handling language, and tracking quality of recommendations. Uneven catalog availability is a challenge because many recommendation algorithms assume that people could interact with any item and then use the absence of interaction implicitly or explicitly as negative information in the model. However, this assumption does not hold globally and across time where item availability differs. Running algorithms globally means needing a notion of location so that we can handle local variations in taste while also providing a good basis for personalization. Language is another challenge in recommending video content because people can typically only enjoy content that has assets (audio, subtitles) in languages they understand. The preferences for how people enjoy such content also vary between people and depend on their familiarity with a language. Also, while would like our recommendations to work well for every one of our members, tracking quality becomes difficult because with so many members in so many countries speaking so many languages, it can be hard to determine when an algorithm or system is performing sub-optimally for some subset of them. Thus, to support this global launch, we examined each and every algorithm that is part of our service and began to address these challenges.",2016,Conference on Recommender Systems,internationalization;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

Mining Information for the Cold-Item Problem,Fatemeh Pourgholamali (Ferdowsi University of Mashhad);,2229338876,"One of the strong points of E-commerce websites is that they are often abundant with product reviews from consumers who experienced the products and testify to the usefulness of the products or otherwise. These reviews are helpful for consumers to optimize their purchasing decisions. However, while popular products receive many reviews, many other products do not have an adequate number of reviews leading to the cold item problem. In this proposal, we propose a solution outline for the cold item problem by automatically generating reviews and predicting ratings for the cold products from available reviews of similar products in e-commerce websites as well as users' opinion shared in the microblogging platforms such as Twitter. We propose a framework to build a formal semantic representation of products from unstructured product descriptions, user reviews as well as user ratings. Such presentations assist us to measure product similarity and relatedness in a accurate and cost-effective way. Besides, we propose a model to generate additional reviews for a cold product by mining users' posts shared on medium such as Twitter and transfer them to the e-commerce website.

However, there remains a large gap between deploying the core algorithm provided by these systems and delivering an application-quality recommendation system, specifically tailored to address complex and dynamically changing business needs. We will present a real-time recommendation engine built on our graph data platform that provides the following extensions to a basic recommendation model: True real-time recommendation algorithms: We provide a simple framework for customers to author and deploy real-time recommendation algorithms with no pre-computation required. Streaming updates of user behavior and product information: As quickly as data are generated, the recommendation engine applies the updates and can serve updated results. Support for offline recommendation algorithms}: Users with existing investment in a quality recommendation program can import their pre-computed results into the graph database for efficient, unified service of results. Tools for Business-centric requirements: The engine offers a range of weighting, sorting, and filtering options to tailor recommendation algorithms to business needs. For example, the engine can eliminate products that are out of stock or favor products that are known to perform well in different real-time contexts. Multiple algorithm ensemble support: There is rarely a case where one algorithm is sufficient to identify the best items to recommend to a user. Integrating points 1 through 4, the engine provides intuitive methods for specifying and combining the results of multiple recommendation algorithms to achieve the highest-performing results. Recommendation feedback tools: Pre- and Post-analysis tools, built around a business' logic, are used to generate reports to assess the value of both potential and currently deployed algorithms. Of particular interest to RecSys attendees, we will discuss the technical aspects of a graph-based implementation of the recommendation engine and how it facilitates the rapid design and deployment of an efficient real-time recommendation system under a single service. We will briefly discuss the architecture of our graph database system to show how it can efficiently serve a large user base even from a single server shared-memory architecture. Attendees will also learn about graph-based data modeling and how viewing data from this perspective can lead to new types of business insights and applications that are not easily implemented using traditional relational and/or NoSQL platforms.

T. Santos (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais);,"2230434534,2389723814,2138048039","The Web has grown into one of the most important channels to communicate social events nowadays. However, the sheer volume of events available in event-based social networks (EBSNs) often undermines the users' ability to choose the events that best fit their interests. Recommender systems appear as a natural solution for this problem, but differently from classic recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, books), the event recommendation problem is intrinsically cold-start. Indeed, events published in EBSNs are typically short-lived and, by definition, are always in the future, having little or no trace of historical attendance. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit several contextual signals available from EBSNs. In particular, besides content-based signals based on the events' description and collaborative signals derived from users' RSVPs, we exploit social signals based on group memberships, location signals based on the users' geographical preferences, and temporal signals derived from the users' time preferences. Moreover, we combine the proposed signals for learning to rank events for personalized recommendation. Thorough experiments using a large crawl of Meetup.com demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual learning approach in contrast to state-of-the-art event recommenders from the literature.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,recommender system;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between preference- and social-based recommendations. We develop social Poisson factorization (SPF), a probabilistic model that incorporates social network information into a traditional factorization method; SPF introduces the social aspect to algorithmic recommendation.

However, some properties, including price discount, can be personalized to respond to each consumer's preference. This paper studies how to automatically set the price discount when recommending a product, in light of the fact that the price will often alter a consumer's purchase decision. The key to optimizing the discount is to predict consumer's willingness-to-pay (WTP), namely, the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a product. Purchase data used by traditional e-commerce recommender systems provide points below or above the decision boundary. In this paper we collected training data to better predict the decision boundary. We implement a new e-commerce mechanism adapted from laboratory lottery and auction experiments that elicit a rational customer's exact WTP for a small subset of products, and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the customer's WTP for other products. The mechanism is implemented on our own e-commerce website that leverages Amazon's data and subjects recruited via Mechanical Turk. The experimental results suggest that this approach can help predict WTP, and boost consumer satisfaction as well as seller profit.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,crowdsourcing;promotion;consumer;recommender system;world wide web;computer science;

These assumptions limit the explorative and predictive capabilities of such models, since users' interests and item popularity may evolve over time. To address this, we propose dPF, a dynamic matrix factorization model based on the recent Poisson factorization model for recommendations. dPF models the time evolving latent factors with a Kalman filter and the actions with Poisson distributions. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm to infer the latent factors. Finally, we demonstrate dPF on 10 years of user click data from arXiv.org, one of the largest repository of scientific papers and a formidable source of information about the behavior of scientists.

Latent Context-Aware Recommender Systems,Moshe Unger (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev);,2227446678,"The emergence of smart mobile devices has given rise to the development of context-aware systems that utilize sensors to collect available data about users. This data, in turn, is used in order to improve various services for the user. The development of such applications is inherently complex, since these applications adapt to changing context information, such as: physical context, computational context, and user tasks. Context information is gathered from a variety of sources that differ in the quality of information they produce and that are often failure-prone. Our study is part of a growing research effort that examines how data collected from mobile devices can be utilized to infer users' behavior and environment. We propose novel approaches that use a rich set of mobile sensors in order to infer unexplored users' contexts in personal models. We also suggest utilizing these high dimensional sensors, which represent users' context for a CARS (context-aware recommender system). For this purpose, we suggest several methods for reducing the dimensionality space by extracting latent contexts from data collected by mobile device sensors. Latent contexts are hidden context patterns, modeled as numeric vectors that are learned for each user automatically, by utilizing unsupervised deep learning techniques on the collected data. We also describe a novel latent context recommendation technique that uses latent contexts and improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art CARS. A preliminary analysis reveals encouraging insights regarding the feasibility of latent contexts and their utilization for context-aware recommendation systems.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,matrix decomposition;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

We conducted our study with the launch of a new version of the MovieLens movie recommender that supports multiple recommender algorithms and allows users to choose the algorithm they want to provide their recommendations. We examine log data from user interactions with this new feature to under-stand whether and how users switch among recommender algorithms, and select a final algorithm to use.

We found that a substantial portion of our user base (25%) used the recommender-switching feature. The majority of users who used the control only switched algorithms a few times, trying a few out and settling down on an algorithm that they would leave alone. The largest number of users prefer a matrix factorization algorithm, followed closely by item-item collaborative filtering; users selected both of these algorithms much more often than they chose a non-personalized mean recommender.

To address this challenge, we study a recommender that puts some control in the hands of users. Specifically, we build and evaluate a system that incorporates user-tuned popularity and recency modifiers, allowing users to express concepts like ""show more popular items"".

Preference-oriented Social Networks: Group Recommendation and Inference,Amirali Salehi-Abari (University of Toronto);Craig Boutilier (University of Toronto);,"328213018,2060802895","Social networks facilitate a variety of social, economic, and political interactions. Homophily---the tendency for people to associate or interact with similar peers---and social influence---the tendency to adopt certain characteristics of those with whom one interacts---suggest that preferences (e.g., over products, services, political parties) are likely to be correlated among people whom directly interact in a social network. We develop a model, preference-oriented social networks, that captures such correlations of individual preferences, where preferences take the form of rankings over a set of options. We develop probabilistic inference methods for predicting individual preferences given observed social connections and partial observations of the preferences of others in the network.

In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information, such as trust and distrust relations in recommendation algorithms. The goal is to improve the quality of suggestions and mitigate the data sparsity and the cold-start users problems in existing systems. In this paper, we introduce a general collaborative social ranking model to rank the latent features of users extracted from rating data based on the social context of users. In contrast to existing social regularization methods, the proposed framework is able to simultaneously leverage trust, distrust, and neutral relations, and has a linear dependency on the social network size. By integrating the ranking based social regularization idea into the matrix factorization algorithm, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, dubbed PushTrust. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset demonstrate that collaboratively ranking the latent features of users by exploiting trust and distrust relations leads to a substantial increase in performance, and to effectively deal with cold-start users problem.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;matrix decomposition;data science;knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
We Know Where You Should Work Next Summer: Job Recommendations,Fabian Abel;,2676322800,"Business-oriented social networks like LinkedIn or XING support people in discovering career opportunities. In this talk, we will focus on the problem of recommending job offers to Millions of XING users. We will discuss challenges of building a job recommendation system that has to satisfy the demands of both job seekers who have certain wishes concerning their next career step and recruiters who aim to hire the most appropriate candidate for a job. Based on insights gained from a large-scale analysis of usage data and profile data such as curriculum vitae, we will study features of the recommendation algorithms that aim to solve the problem. Job advertisements typically describe the job role that the candidate will need to fill, required skills, the expected educational background that candidates should have and the company and environment in which candidates will be working. Users of professional social networks curate their profile and curriculum vitae in which they describe their skills, interests and previous career steps. Recommending jobs to users is however a non-trivial task for which pure content-based features that would just match the aforementioned properties are not sufficient. For example, we often observe that there is a gap between what people specify in their profiles and what they are actually interested in. Moreover, profile and CV typically describe the past and current situation of a user but do not reflect enough the actual demands that users have with respect to their next career step. Therefore, it is crucial to also analyze the behavior of the users and exploit interaction data such as search queries, clicks on jobs, bookmarks, clicks that similar users performed, etc. Our job recommendation system exploits various features in order to estimate whether a job posting is relevant for a user or not. Some of these features rather reflect social aspects (e.g. does the user have contacts that are living in the city in which the job is offered?) while others capture to what extent the user fulfills the requirements of the role that is described in the job advertisement (e.g. similarity of user's skills and required skills). To better understand appropriate next career steps, we mine the CVs of the users and learn association rules that describe the typical career paths. This information is also made publicly available via FutureMe - a tool that allows people to explore possible career opportunities and identify professions that may be interesting for them to work in. One of the challenges when developing the job recommendation system is to collect explicit feedback and thus understanding (i) whether a recommended job was relevant for a user and (ii) whether the user was a good candidate for the job. We thus started to stronger involve users in providing feedback and build a feedback cycle that allows the recommender system to automatically adapt to the feedback that the crowd of users is providing. By displaying explanations about why certain items were suggested, we furthermore aim to increase transparency of how the recommender system works.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,job shadow;job analysis;social network;recommender system;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

Such sources include multiple user-user and item-item similarity measures, content, and social information. HyPER automatically learns to balance these different information signals when making predictions. We build our system using a powerful and intuitive probabilistic programming language called probabilistic soft logic, which enables efficient and accurate prediction by formulating our custom recommender systems with a scalable class of graphical models known as hinge-loss Markov random fields.

In recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing new solutions that address the cold-start problem. These solutions are mainly based on the idea of exploiting other sources of information to compensate for the lack of rating data. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework based on matrix factorization that simultaneously exploits the similarity information among users and items to alleviate the cold-start problem. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed algorithm decouples the following two aspects of the cold-start problem: (a) the completion of a rating sub-matrix, which is generated by excluding cold-start users and items from the original rating matrix; and (b) the transduction of knowledge from existing ratings to cold-start items/users using side information. This crucial difference significantly boosts the performance when appropriate side information is incorporated. We provide theoretical guarantees on the estimation error of the proposed two-stage algorithm based on the richness of similarity information in capturing the rating data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that addresses the cold-start problem with provable guarantees. We also conduct thorough experiments on synthetic and real datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and highlights the usefulness of auxiliary information in dealing with both cold-start users and items.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,cold start;sparsity of effects principle;matrix decomposition;data science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Gaussian Ranking by Matrix Factorization,Harald Steck (Netflix);,2304435512,"The ranking quality at the top of the list is crucial in many real-world applications of recommender systems. In this paper, we present a novel framework that allows for pointwise as well as listwise training with respect to various ranking metrics.

We motivate this assumption from the properties of implicit feedback data. As a model, we use matrix factorization and extend it by non-linear activation functions, as customary in the literature of artificial neural networks. In particular, we use non-linear activation functions derived from our Gaussian assumption.

The utility of an item for a user, however, may vary greatly depending on that user's specific situation or the context in which the item is used. Without considering these changes in preferences, the recommendations may match the general preferences of a user, but they may have small value for the user in his/her current situation. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical hidden Markov model for capturing changes in user's preferences. Using a user's feedback sequence on items, we model the user as a hierarchical hidden Markov process and the current context of the user as a hidden variable in this model. For a given user, our model is used to infer the maximum likelihood sequence of transitions between contextual states and to predict the probability distribution for the context of the next action. The predicted context is then used to generate recommendations.

Cross-domain collaborative filtering aims to transfer the user rating pattern from source (auxiliary) domains to a target domain for the purpose of alleviating the sparsity problem and providing better target recommendations. However, the studies so far have either focused on a limited number of domains that are assumed to be related to each other (such as books and movies), or a division of the same dataset (such as movies) into different domains based on an item characteristic (such as genre). In this paper, we study a broad set of domains and their characteristics to understand the factors that affect the success or failure of cross-domain collaborative filtering, the amount of improvement in cross-domain approaches, and the selection of best source domains for a specific target domain. We propose to use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a significant major factor in finding the most promising source domains for a target domain, and suggest a cross-domain collaborative filtering based on CCA (CD-CCA) that proves to be successful in using the shared information between domains in the target recommendations.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,canonical correlation;collaborative filtering;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

It arises when new items are added to the inventory and the system cannot model them properly since it relies solely on historical users' interactions (e.g., ratings). Much work has been devoted to mitigate this problem mostly by employing hybrid approaches that combine content-based recommendation techniques or by devoting a portion of the user traffic for exploration to gather interactions from random users. We focus on pure CF recommender systems (i.e., without content or context information) in a realistic online setting, where random exploration is inefficient and smart exploration that carefully selects users is crucial due to the huge flux of new items with short lifespan. We further assume that users arrive randomly one after the other and that the system has to immediately decide whether the arriving user will participate in the exploration of the new items. For this setting we present ExcUseMe, a smart exploration algorithm that selects a predefined number of users for exploring new items. ExcUseMe gradually excavates the users that are more likely to be interested in the new items and models the new items based on the users' interactions.

Recommendation techniques have the possibility of helping VCs making data-driven investment decisions by providing an automatic screening process of a large number of startups across different domains on the basis of their past investment data. A previous study has shown the potential advantage of using collaborative filtering to catch and predict the VCs' investment behaviours. However, two fundamental challenges in venture finance make conventional recommendation techniques difficult to apply. First, risk factors should be cautiously considered when making investments: for a potential startup, a VC needs to specifically estimate how well this new investment can fit into its holding investment portfolio in such a way that investment risk can be hedged. Second, The investment behaviours are much sparser than conventional recommendation applications and a VC's investments are usually limited to a few industry categories, making it impossible to use a topic-diversification method to hedge the risk. In this paper, we solve the startup recommendation problem from a risk management perspective.

An article is defined to be comment-worthy for a particular user if that user is interested to leave a comment on it. We note that recommending comment-worthy articles calls for elicitation of commenting-interests of the user from the content of both the articles and the past comments made by users. We thus propose to develop content-driven user profiles to elicit these latent interests of users in commenting and use them to recommend articles for future commenting. The difficulty of modeling comment content and the varied nature of users' commenting interests make the problem technically challenging. The problem of recommending comment-worthy articles is resolved by leveraging article and comment content through topic modeling and the co-commenting pattern of users through collaborative filtering, combined within a novel hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. Our solution, Collaborative Correspondence Topic Models (CCTM), generates user profiles which are leveraged to provide a personalized ranking of comment-worthy articles for each user. Through these content-driven user profiles, CCTM effectively handle the ubiquitous problem of cold-start without relying on additional meta-data. The inference problem for the model is intractable with no off-the-shelf solution and we develop an efficient Monte Carlo EM algorithm.

Incremental Matrix Factorization via Feature Space Re-learning for Recommender System,Qiang Song (Chinese Academy of Sciences);Jian Cheng (Chinese Academy of Sciences);Hanqing Lu (Chinese Academy of Sciences);,"2708766351,2337615961,2096321700","Matrix factorization is widely used in Recommender Systems. Although existing popular incremental matrix factorization methods are effectively in reducing time complexity, they simply assume that the similarity between items or users is invariant. For instance, they keep the item feature matrix unchanged and just update the user matrix without re-training the entire model. However, with the new users growing continuously, the fitting error would be accumulated since the extra distribution information of items has not been utilized. In this paper, we present an alternative and reasonable approach, with a relaxed assumption that the similarity between items (users) is relatively stable after updating.

Exploiting Geo-Spatial Preference for Personalized Expert Recommendation,Haokai Lu (Texas A&M University);James Caverlee (Texas A&M University);,"2305711674,2028974103","Experts are important for providing reliable and authoritative information and opinion, as well as for improving online reviews and services. While considerable previous research has focused on finding topical experts with broad appeal -- e.g., top Java developers, best lawyers in Texas -- we tackle the problem of personalized expert recommendation, to identify experts who have special personal appeal and importance to users. One of the key insights motivating our approach is to leverage the geo-spatial preferences of users and the variation of these preferences across different regions, topics, and social communities. Through a fine-grained GPS-tagged social media trace, we characterize these geo-spatial preferences for personalized experts, and integrate these preferences into a matrix factorization-based personalized expert recommender. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed approach can improve the quality of recommendation by 24% in precision compared to several baselines. We also find that users' geo-spatial preference of expertise and their underlying social communities can ameliorate the cold start problem by more than 20% in precision and recall.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

We therefore claim that it is possible to learn a model of good and bad contexts for recommendations that can later be integrated in a recommender system. Using mobile data collected during a three week user study, we suggest a two-phase model that is able to classify whether a certain context is at all suitable for any recommendation, regardless of its content.

Asymmetric Recommendations: The Interacting Effects of Social Ratings? Direction and Strength on Users' Ratings,Oded Nov (New York University);Ofer Arazy (University of Haifa);,"2101239765,57754828","In social recommendation systems, users often publicly rate objects such as photos, news articles or consumer products. When they appear in aggregate, these ratings carry social signals such as the direction and strength of the raters' average opinion about the product. Using a controlled experiment we manipulated two central social signals -- the direction and strength of social ratings of five popular consumer products -- and examined their interacting effects on users' ratings. The results show an asymmetric user behavior, where the direction of perceived social rating has a negative effect on users' ratings if the direction of perceived social rating is negative, but no effect if the direction is positive. The strength of perceived social ratings did not have a significant effect on users' ratings. The findings highlight the potential for cascading adverse effects of small number of negative user ratings on subsequent users' opinions.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,anchoring;social influence;recommender system;

Uncovering Systematic Bias in Ratings across Categories: a Bayesian Approach,Fangjian Guo (Duke University);David B. Dunson (Duke University);,"2150083319,2649524577","Recommender systems are routinely equipped with standardized taxonomy that associates each item with one or more categories or genres. Although such information does not directly imply the quality of an item, the distribution of ratings vary greatly across categories, e.g. animation movies may generally receive higher ratings than action movies. While it is a natural outcome given the diversity and heterogeneity of both users and items, it makes directly aggregated ratings, which are commonly used to guide users' choice by reflecting the overall quality of an item, incomparable across categories and hence prone to fairness and diversity issues. This paper aims to uncover and calibrate systematic category-wise biases for discrete-valued ratings. We propose a novel Bayesian multiplicative probit model that treats the inflation or deflation of mean rating for a combination of categories as multiplicatively contributed from category-specific parameters. The posterior distribution of those parameters, as inferred from data, can capture the bias for all possible combinations of categories, thus enabling statistically efficient estimation and principled rating calibration.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,category;bayesian inference;bias;taxonomy;world wide web;data mining;

Are Real-World Place Recommender Algorithms Useful in Virtual World Environments?,Leandro Balby Marinho (Federal University of Campina Grande);Christoph Trattner (Norwegian University of Science and Technology);Denis Parra (Pontifical Catholic University of Chile);,"2389723814,335633559,2166181490","Large scale virtual worlds such as massive multiplayer online games or 3D worlds gained tremendous popularity over the past few years. With the large and ever increasing amount of content available, virtual world users face the information overload problem. To tackle this issue, game-designers usually deploy recommendation services with the aim of making the virtual world a more joyful environment to be connected at. In this context, we present in this paper the results of a project that aims at understanding the mobility patterns of virtual world users in order to derive place recommenders for helping them to explore content more efficiently. Our study focus on the virtual world SecondLife, one of the largest and most prominent in recent years. Since SecondLife is comparable to real-world Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs), i.e., users can both check-in and share visited virtual places, a natural approach is to assume that place recommenders that are known to work well on real-world LBSNs will also work well on SecondLife. We have put this assumption to the test and found out that (i) while collaborative filtering algorithms have compatible performances in both environments, (ii) existing place recommenders based on geographic metadata are not useful in SecondLife.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,multimedia;world wide web;simulation;computer science;

A Hybrid Recommendation System Based on Human Curiosity,Alan Menk dos Santos (Polytechnic University of Valencia);,2226087259,"Traditional recommendation systems use multiple computational techniques to perform personalized recommendations, and can consider the interests of users and even the context in which they live. However, they usually ignore each individual's personality factors, and hence, the recommendations generated overwhelmingly consider that all the users are identical psychologically. They ignore, for example, the curiosity level of each user, which may indicate that individuals with a high level of curiosity seek visit exotic locations and/or not yet visited by them, or even individuals with a low curiosity level tend to do the same things they did in the past, uninterested in new or different areas. Our paper presents a complete hybrid recommendation system considering the curiosity level of each individual as a decisive factor to recommend sites of South America. In order to prove the efficiency of our system in contrast to traditional recommendation systems, as well as to measure the satisfaction of users about the recommendations, we performed some preliminary experiments with the participation of 105 Brazilian volunteers. The first results indicate that considering the level of curiosity of a user increases the satisfaction with the recommendations.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,curiosity;social media;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;artificial intelligence;simulation;computer science;

Selection and Ordering of Linear Online Video Ads,Wreetabrata Kar (Adobe Systems);Viswanathan Swaminathan (Adobe Systems);Paulo Albuquerque (INSEAD);,"2231353491,2145450784,2472706841","This paper studies the selection and ordering of in-stream ads in videos shown in online content publishers. We propose an allocation algorithm that uses a collective measure of price and quality for each ad and factors in slot-specific continuation probabilities to maximize publisher revenue. The algorithm is based on cascade models and uses a dynamic programming method to assign linear (video) ads to slots in an online video. The approach accounts for the negative externality created by lower quality ads placed in a video, leading to viewer exit and thereby preventing the publisher from showing the subsequent ads scheduled in that session. Our algorithm is scalable and suited for real-time applications. A large log of viewer activity from a video ad platform is used to empirically test the algorithm. A series of simulations show that our algorithm, when compared to other algorithms currently practiced in industry, generates more revenue for the publisher and increases viewer retention.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,world wide web;simulation;computer science;

"Personalized Catch-up & DVR: VOD or Linear, That is the Question",Pancrazio Auteri;Roberto Turrin (Instituto Politécnico Nacional);,"2224780578,2032104361","The expansion of TV services such as DVR and, more recently, Catch-up have removed the temporal constraint typical of the Linear ""appointment"" TV enabling users to watch content they love at any time and on-demand. However, the DVR and Catch-up TV libraries, while providing a convenient time-shifted ""on-demand"" consumption, are indeed composed by content recently aired on a linear channel, so that they have more in common with Linear TV than they have with VOD. In this talk we will present and discuss the main challenges and some possible solutions to personalize the user experience with content from DVR and Catch-up TV, such as: (i) The consumption pattern is strongly affected by the context (e.g., time and device used to access the video service). (ii) Some content is consumed serially and still follows seasonal dynamics (e.g., TV Series). (iii) The system is fed with a massive and very dynamic streams of data (e.g., new content arriving right after broadcast, signals of user interactions). (iv) The same piece of content may coexist across multiple services provided by the same operator (e.g., linear schedule, network-DVR, catch-up TV, subscription VOD, rental VOD).",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,predictive analytics;personalization;recommender system;internet privacy;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;
Nuke 'Em Till They Go: Investigating Power User Attacks to Disparage Items in Collaborative Recommenders,Carlos E. Seminario (University of North Carolina at Charlotte);David C. Wilson (University of North Carolina at Charlotte);,"2145590328,2443776490","Recommender Systems (RSs) can be vulnerable to manipulation by malicious users who successfully bias recommendations for their own benefit or pleasure. These are known as attacks on RSs and are typically used to either promote (""push"") or disparage (""nuke"") targeted items contained within the recommender's user-item dataset. Our recent work with the Power User Attack (PUA) model, determined that attackers disguised as influential power users can mount successful (from the attacker's viewpoint) push attacks against user-based, item-based, and SVD-based recommenders. However, the success of push attack vectors may not be symmetric for nuke attacks, which target the opposite effect --- reducing the likelihood that target items appear in users' top-N lists. The asymmetry between push and nuke attacks is highlighted when evaluating these attacks using traditional robustness metrics such as Rank and Prediction Shift. This paper examines the PUA attack model in the context of nuke attacks, in order to investigate the differences between push and nuke attack orientations, as well as how they are evaluated. In this work we show that the PUA is able to mount successful nuke attacks against commonly-used recommender algorithms highlighting the ""nuke vs. push"" asymmetry in the results.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,evaluation;recommender system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer science;
Scaling Up Recommendation Services in Many Dimensions,Bottyán Németh (Budapest University of Technology and Economics);,2098177479,"Gravity R&D has been providing recommendation engines as SaaS solutions since 2009. The company has a strong research focus and recommendation quality has always been their primary differentiating factor. Widely used or open source recommendation algorithms are of little use to our technology team as a result of the superiority of our in-house developed, proprietary algorithms. Gravity R&D experienced many challenges while scaling up their services. The sheer quantity of data handled on a daily basis increased exponentially. This presentation will cover how overcoming these challenges permanently shaped our algorithms and system architecture used to generate these recommendations. Serving personalized recommendations requires real-time computation and data access for every single request. To generate responses in real-time, current user inputs have to be compared against their history in order to deliver accurate recommendations. We then combine this user information with specific details about available items as the next step in the recommendation process. It becomes more difficult to provide accurate recommendations as the number of transactions and items increase. It also becomes difficult because this type of analysis requires the combination of multiple heterogeneous algorithms that all require different inputs. Initially, the architecture was designed for MF based models and serving huge numbers of requests but with a limited number of items. Now, Gravity is using MF, neighborhood based models and metadata based models to generate recommendations for millions of items within their databases. This required a shift from a monolithic architecture with in-process caching to a more service oriented architecture with multi-layer caching. As a result of an increase in the number of components and number of clients, managing the infrastructure can be quite difficult. Even with these challenges, we don't believe that it is worthwhile to use a fully distributed system. It adds unneeded complexity, resources, and overhead to the system. We prefer an approach of firstly optimizing current algorithms and architecture and only moving to a distributed system when no other options are left.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,scalability;performance;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

"The Application of Recommender Systems in a Multi Site, Multi Domain Environment",Steven Bourke (University College Dublin);,2136596855,"Recommender systems have cemented themselves in the daily experiences of most online users. In this work we will elaborate on the different challenges faced when creating recommendations in the following domains - Online marketplaces: Two sided marketplaces where buyers and sellers can interact and sell items with each other. - Online News: Online news sites where users consume the latest news articles related to current affairs. - Generic Recommendations: Sites which create generic recommendations based on generalised algorithms. We will review how we address these different challenges in Schibsted. Schibsted is an international media company with over 200 million unique users a month, split across 39 countries across the world. Concretely we will review, and compare the primary challenges between the different domains mentioned as well as the commonalities and general lessons we have learnt. For example in a two sided marketplace, it is important that both actors in the interaction are considered when creating recommendations. Constraints such as price sensitivity and geographical location become important when identifying good quality recommendations for our users. Alternatively, in online news we need to consider issues such as freshness and topical relevance when creating recommendations for users, while also striving to ensure we have editorial satisfaction. Finally we can look to generic recommendation solutions where we provide simple recommendation API end points. In this case it is important to ensure good quality recommendations while ensuring a generic enough solution that it can be used in many different scenarios. What makes these challenges particularly interesting is that we approach these different challenges with a holistic view of for improving the overall user experience for our users in Schibsted.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,news;e commerce;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

Purchase Prediction and Item Suggestion based on HTTP sessions in absence of User Information,Pouya Esmailian (Sharif University of Technology);Mahdi Jalili (RMIT University);,"322945797,2543816312","In this paper, the task is to determine whether an HTTP session buys an item, or not, and if so, which items will be purchased. An HTTP session is a series of item clicks. A session has type buy, if it buys at least one item, or non-buy otherwise. Accordingly, data is in (session, item, time) format, which tells us when an item is clicked or purchased during an HTTP session. The main challenge comes from the fact that (1) user information is not available for clicked or purchased items, which are merely tagged with anonymous sessions, and (2) suggestions are highly temporal as they are suggested to sessions instead of users. In other words, users which are stable and identified are replaced with sessions which are temporal and anonymous. In this work, we propose a feature-based system that predicts the type of a session, and determines which items are going to be purchased. As the main contribution, we have modeled sessions separated by the number of unique items, prioritized item-features based on the number of clicks, and utilized cumulative statistics of similar items to attenuate the sparsity problem.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,recommender system;internet privacy;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

Given a dataset of item click sessions, the problem is to predict whether a session results in a purchase and which items are purchased if the answer is yes. We define a simpler analogous problem where given an item and its session, we try to predict the probability of purchase for the given item. For each session, the predictions result in a set of purchased items or often an empty set. We apply monthly time windows over the dataset. For each item in a session, we engineer features regarding the session, the item properties, and the time window. Then, a balanced random forest classifier is trained to perform predictions on the test set. The dataset is particularly challenging due to privacy-preserving definition of a session, the class imbalance problem, and the volume of data. We report our findings with respect to feature engineering, the choice of sampling schemes, and classifier ensembles. Experimental results together with benefits and shortcomings of the proposed approach are discussed.

A (Persuasive?) Speech on Automated Persuasion,Oliviero Stock;,2609436229,"Philosophers of language have taught us that at the basis of language production there is the intention to change the state of the world by intervening linguistically on other agents. Persuasion, being the process of influencing attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, mood of a target, is a matter of stronger emphasis. Argumentation is just one resource to persuasion; it has been studied since the times of Aristotle and now for quite some time in artificial intelligence. The peripheral route to persuasion [1] is a different modality, one that is based on indirect, evocative, aesthetic aspects of the message. Automated intelligent persuasion of this sort (and also defense from inappropriate persuasion) is a research area close to producing usable results, both through creative production of language expressions, and through other forms of communication. The traditional goal of human-oriented information technology is mostly to offer services. With intelligent persuasive interfaces, instead, the overall goal is to produce an effect on humans, to influence their beliefs, their attitudes and eventually their actions and overall behavior. The area of intelligent persuasion has the potential to change the picture radically in the world of advertising and of social influencing. Computer-based systems can be flexible, and starting from goals they have to pursue, they can take into account the situation and the specific target, adapt the messages in appropriate ways and assess the outcome. In addition, the availability of very large amounts of data which can be exploited also in real time provides unprecedented possibilities. It is easy now to predict the following developments for the advertising sector: reduction in time to market and extension of possible occasions for advertisement; overall reduction of off target messages, eliminating the less relevant for the individual in a given situation; more attention to the wearing out of the message and to the need for planning variants and connected messages across time and space; contextual personalization, on the basis of audience profile and dynamic model (emotional state, beliefs, goals, etc.) and situational information; interactivity; audience reaction monitoring and system feedback on message effectiveness . In the Per Te project we have explored several areas concerned with intelligent persuasion. One topic is concerned with getting the attention and evoking a desired concept by means of original linguistic expressions. A main theme is the automatic production of flexible creative messages [2]. The approach is based on developing specific techniques, mostly corpus based, for producing variations of given expressions [3]. Another theme is concerned with ambient intelligence and peripheral displays. A novel technology is able to indirectly but purposefully impact on the behavior of a co-located group of people. Continuous recognition of each individual's focus of attention and activity is used to drive a tabletop interface aimed at facilitating group interaction during a brainstorming-style activity [4}. We believe one of the ultimate criteria for interactive systems' acceptability is going to be the moral implications of their actions. Persuasion is a sensitive topic and we believe ethics has to be studied from now, in view of granting systems will be accepted by users. We have conducted experiments based on the approach of moral dilemmas, so to understand what persuasion means are acceptable in stressed contexts [5]. In conclusion the potential of intelligent persuasion systems is great, not only for commercial applications but also with a societal view: for influencing social attitudes of people and leading to better social behavior.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,regulatory focus theory;creativity;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

However, utilizing the information for recommendation could be dicult, because such information is usually sparse. To address this issue, we propose to learn the latent social listening representations by the DeepWalk method, and then integrate the learned representations into Factorization Machines to construct better recommendation models. With the DeepWalk method, user social relationships can be transformed from the sparse and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) form into a dense and noni.i.d. form. In addition, the latent representations can also capture the spatial locality among users and items, therefore beneting the constructed recommendation models.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,graph;social network;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

One typical experimental setup is to rst present the participants with recommendation lists that were created with dierent algorithms and then ask the participants to assess these recommendations individually or to compare two item lists. The cognitive eort required by the participants for the evaluation of item recommendations in such settings depends on whether or not they already know the (features of the) recommended items. Furthermore, lists containing popular and broadly known items are correspondingly easier to evaluate. In this paper we report the results of a user study in which participants recruited on a crowdsourcing platform assessed system-provided recommendations in a between-subjects experimental design. The results surprisingly showed that users found non-personalized recommendations of popular items the best match for their preferences. An analysis revealed a measurable correlation between item familiarity and user acceptance. Overall, the observations indicate that item familiarity can be a potential confounding factor in such studies and should be considered in experimental designs.",2015,Conference on Recommender Systems,multimedia;world wide web;computer science;

Additionally, algorithmic implementations can diverge from the standard formulation due to manual tuning and modifications that work better in some situations. In this work we compare common recommendation algorithms as implemented in three popular recommendation frameworks. To provide a fair comparison, we have complete control of the evaluation dimensions being benchmarked: dataset, data splitting, evaluation strategies, and metrics. We also include results using the internal evaluation mechanisms of these frameworks.

Item cold-start recommendations: learning local collective embeddings,Martin Saveski (Yahoo!);Amin Mantrach (Yahoo!);,"278134592,2027707398","Recommender systems suggest to users items that they might like (e.g., news articles, songs, movies) and, in doing so, they help users deal with information overload and enjoy a personalized experience. One of the main problems of these systems is the item cold-start, i.e., when a new item is introduced in the system and no past information is available, then no effective recommendations can be produced. The item cold-start is a very common problem in practice: modern online platforms have hundreds of new items published every day. To address this problem, we propose to learn Local Collective Embeddings : a matrix factorization that exploits items' properties and past user preferences while enforcing the manifold structure exhibited by the collective embeddings. We present a learning algorithm based on multiplicative update rules that are efficient and easy to implement.

We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity - including those adapted from search result diversification - fail to address adequately these three properties.

Question recommendation with constraints for massive open online courses,Diyi Yang (Carnegie Mellon University);David Adamson (Carnegie Mellon University);Carolyn Penstein Rosé (Carnegie Mellon University);,"2127567756,2496579715,2152131012","Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have experienced a recent boom in interest. Problems students struggle with in the discussion forums, such as difficultly in finding interesting discussion opportunities or attracting helpers to address posted problems, provide new opportunities for recommender systems. In contrast to traditional product recommendation, question recommendation in discussion forums should simultaneously consider constraints on both students and questions. These considerations include (1) Load Balancing - students should not be over-burdened with too many requests; and (2) Expertise Matching - students should not be requested to address problems they are not capable of addressing. In this work, we formulate a novel constrained question recommendation problem to address the above considerations. We design a context-aware matrix factorization model to predict students' preferences over questions, then build a max cost flow model to manage the constraints. Experimental results conducted on three MOOC datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in optimizing overall forum welfare, and in predicting which specific questions students might be interested in.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,load balancing;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

In such systems, a higher inner product between a user vector and an item vector indicates that the item better suits the user's preference. Traditionally, retrieving the most suitable items is done by scoring and sorting all items. Real world online recommender systems must adhere to strict response-time constraints, so when the number of items is large, scoring all items is intractable. We propose a novel order preserving transformation, mapping the maximum inner product search problem to Euclidean space nearest neighbor search problem. Utilizing this transformation, we study the efficiency of several (approximate) nearest neighbor data structures. Our final solution is based on a novel use of the PCA-Tree data structure in which results are augmented using paths one hamming distance away from the query (neighborhood boosting). The end result is a system which allows approximate matches (items with relatively high inner product, but not necessarily the highest one).

Using graded implicit feedback for bayesian personalized ranking,Lukas Lerche (Technical University of Dortmund);Dietmar Jannach (Technical University of Dortmund);,"2128028020,208543431","In many application domains of recommender systems, explicit rating information is sparse or non-existent. The preferences of the current user have therefore to be approximated by interpreting his or her behavior, i.e., the implicit user feedback. In the literature, a number of algorithm proposals have been made that rely solely on such implicit feedback, among them Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). In the BPR approach, pairwise comparisons between the items are made in the training phase and an item i is considered to be preferred over item j if the user interacted in some form with i but not with j . In real-world applications, however, implicit feedback is not necessarily limited to such binary decisions as there are, e.g., different types of user actions like item views, cart or purchase actions and there can exist several actions for an item over time. In this paper we show how BPR can be extended to deal with such more fine-granular, graded preference relations. An empirical analysis shows that this extension can help to measurably increase the predictive accuracy of BPR on realistic e-commerce datasets.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,evaluation;recommender system;knowledge management;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

In many recommendation and personalization applications, particularly in domains where user context changes dynamically, it is difficult to represent and model contextual factors directly, but it is often possible to observe their impact on user preferences during the course of users' interactions with the system. In this paper, we introduce an interactive recommender system that can detect and adapt to changes in context based on the user's ongoing behavior. The system, then, dynamically tailors its recommendations to match the user's most recent preferences. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling heuristic to learn a model for the user. Following the Thompson sampling approach, the user model is updated after each interaction as the system observes the corresponding rewards for the recommendations provided during that interaction. To generate contextual recommendations, the user's preference model is monitored for changes at each step of interaction with the user and is updated incrementally. We will introduce a mechanism for detecting significant changes in the user's preferences and will describe how it can be used to improve the performance of the recommender system.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,computer user satisfaction;thompson sampling;multi armed bandit;user;collaborative filtering;user modeling;knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

To facilitate browsing and selection, almost all recommender systems display average ratings before accepting ratings from users which has been shown to bias ratings. This effect is called Social Inuence Bias (SIB); the tendency to conform to the perceived \norm"" in a community. We propose a methodology to 1) learn, 2) analyze, and 3) mitigate the effect of SIB in recommender systems. In the Learning phase, we build a baseline dataset by allowing users to rate twice: before and after seeing the average rating. In the Analysis phase, we apply a new non-parametric significance test based on the Wilcoxon statistic to test whether the data is consistent with SIB. If significant, we propose a Mitigation phase using polynomial regression and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to predict unbiased ratings. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 9390 ratings from the California Report Card (CRC), a rating-based system designed to encourage political engagement. We found statistically significant evidence of SIB. Mitigating models were able to predict changed ratings with a normalized RMSE of 12.8% and reduce bias by 76.3%.

We generate recommendations based on factorizing the tensor, by weighting the importance of past user preferences according to their UPD values. We additionally exploit users' side data, such as demographics, which can help improving the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled, tensor-matrix factorization scheme.

The ensemble is acquired by aggregating different pulling policies of bandit algorithms, rather than forcing the agreement of prediction results or learning a unified predictive model. To this end, we employ a meta-bandit paradigm that places a hyper bandit over the base bandits, to explicitly explore/exploit the relative importance of base bandits based on user feedbacks.

We address the inverted task by two approaches: a) inverting the rating matrix, and b) defining a probabilistic reformulation which isolates the popularity component of arbitrary recommendation algorithms. We find that the first approach gives rise to interesting reformulations of nearest-neighbor algorithms, which essentially introduce a new neighbor selection policy.

Differently from state-of-the-art methods, the method proposed is designed to optimize the AUC directly within a margin maximization paradigm. Specifically, this turns out in a simple constrained quadratic optimization problem, one for each user. Experiments performed on several benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods in terms of AUC of the obtained predictions.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;data mining;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;
Cold-start news recommendation with domain-dependent browse graph,Michele Trevisiol (Pompeu Fabra University);Luca Maria Aiello (Yahoo!);Rossano Schifanella (University of Turin);Alejandro Jaimes (Yahoo!);,"1999894087,2072290952,2200389328,2193615068","Online social networks and mash-up services create opportunities to connect different web services otherwise isolated. Specifically in the case of news, users are very much exposed to news articles while performing other activities, such as social networking or web searching. Browsing behavior aimed at the consumption of news, especially in relation to the visits coming from other domains, has been mainly overlooked in previous work. To address that, we build a BrowseGraph out of the collective browsing traces extracted from a large viewlog of Yahoo News (0.5B entries), and we define the ReferrerGraph as its subgraph induced by the sessions with the same referrer domain. The structural and temporal properties of the graph show that browsing behavior in news is highly dependent on the referrer URL of the session, in terms of type of content consumed and time of consumption. We build on this observation and propose a news recommender that addresses the cold-start problem: given a user landing on a page of the site for the first time, we aim to predict the page she will visit next. We compare 24 flavors of recommenders belonging to the families of content-based, popularity-based, and browsing-based models. We show that the browsing-based recommender that takes into account the referrer URL is the best performing, achieving a prediction accuracy of 48% in conditions of heavy data sparsity.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,cold start;recommender system;internet privacy;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;
Towards a dynamic top-N recommendation framework,Xin Liu (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);Karl Aberer (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);,"2635816614,150096297","Real world large-scale recommender systems are always dynamic: new users and items continuously enter the system, and the status of old ones (e.g., users' preference and items' popularity) evolve over time. In order to handle such dynamics, we propose a recommendation framework consisting of an online component and an offline component, where the newly arrived items are processed by the online component such that users are able to get suggestions for fresh information, and the influence of longstanding items is captured by the offline component. Based on individual users' rating behavior, recommendations from the two components are combined to provide top- N recommendation. We formulate recommendation problem as a ranking problem where learning to rank is applied to extend upon matrix factorization to optimize item rankings by minimizing a pairwise loss function. Furthermore, to better model interactions between users and items, Latent Dirichlet Allocation is incorporated to fuse rating information and textual information. Real data based experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by at least 61.21% and 50.27% in terms of mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) respectively.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,topic model;matrix decomposition;learning to rank;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Weighted hybrid recommendation for heterogeneous networks,Fatemeh Vahedian (DePaul University);,81489777,"Social media sites accumulate a wide variety of information about users: likes and ratings, friend and follower links, annotations, posts, media uploads, just to name a few. Key challenges for recommender systems research are (a) to synthesize of all of this data into an integrated recommendation model and (b) to support a wide variety of recommendation types simultaneously (items, friends, tags, etc.) One approach that has been explored in recent research is to view this multi-faceted data as a heterogeneous network and use network-based methods of generating recommendations. However, most such approaches involve computationally-intensive model generation resulting in a single-purpose recommender system. Our approach is to create a component-based hybrid model whose components can be reused for multiple recommendation tasks. In this paper, we show how this model can be applied to heterogeneous networks.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,heterogeneous network;information theory;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;computer science;
Question recommendation for collaborative question answering systems with RankSLDA,Jose San Pedro (Telefónica);Alexandros Karatzoglou (Telefónica);,"2097444444,14841688","Collaborative question answering (CQA) communities rely on user participation for their success. This paper presents a supervised Bayesian approach to model expertise in on-line CQA communities with application to question recommendation, aimed at reducing waiting times for responses and avoiding question starvation. We propose a novel algorithm called RankSLDA which extends the supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model by considering a learning-to-rank paradigm. This allows us to exploit the inherent collaborative effects that are present in CQA communities where users tend to answer questions in their topics of expertise. Users can thus be modeled on the basis of the topics in which they demonstrate expertise. In the supervised stage of the method we model the pairwise order of expertise of users on a given question. We compare RankSLDA against several alternative methods on data from the Cross Validate community, part of the Stack Exchange network.

Factored MDPs for detecting topics of user sessions,Maryam Tavakol (Technische Universität Darmstadt);Ulf Brefeld (Technische Universität Darmstadt);,"2231919121,158112295",Recommender systems aim to capture interests of users to provide tailored recommendations. User interests are however often unique and depend on many unobservable factors including a user's mood and the local weather. We take a contextual session-based approach and propose a sequential framework using factored Markov decision processes (fMDPs) to detect the user's goal (the topic) of a session. We show that an independence assumption on the attributes of items leads to a set of independent models that can be optimised efficiently. Our approach results in interpretable topics that can be effectively turned into recommendations. Empirical results on a real world click log from a large e-commerce company exhibit highly accurate topic prediction rates of about 90%. Translating our approach into a topic-driven recommender system outperforms several baseline competitors.,2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Bayesian binomial mixture model for collaborative prediction with non-random missing data,Yong-Deok Kim (Pohang University of Science and Technology);Seungjin Choi (Pohang University of Science and Technology);,"2124543637,2128913862","Collaborative prediction involves filling in missing entries of a user-item matrix to predict preferences of users based on their observed preferences. Most of existing models assume that the data is missing at random (MAR), which is often violated in recommender systems in practice. Incorrect assumption on missing data ignores the missing data mechanism, leading to biased inferences and prediction. In this paper we present a Bayesian binomial mixture model for collaborative prediction, where the generative process for data and missing data mechanism are jointly modeled to handle non-random missing data . Missing data mechanism is modeled by three factors, each of which is related to users, items, and rating values. Each factor is modeled by Bernoulli random variable, and the observation of rating value is determined by the Boolean OR operation of three binary variables. We develop computationally-efficient variational inference algorithms, where variational parameters have closed-form update rules and the computational complexity depends on the number of observed ratings, instead of the size of the rating data matrix. We also discuss implementation issues on hyperparameter tuning and estimation based on empirical Bayes. Experiments on Yahoo! Music and MovieLens datasets confirm the useful behavior of our model by demonstrating that: (1) it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in yielding higher predictive performance; (2) it finds meaningful solutions instead of undesirable boundary solutions; (3) it provides rating trend analysis on why ratings are observed.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;imputation;missing data;recommender system;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

In this paper, we explore the expert retrieval problem and implement an automatic paper-reviewer recommendation system that considers aspects of expertise, authority, and diversity. In particular, a graph is first constructed on the possible reviewers and the query paper, incorporating expertise and authority information. Then a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) [1] model is employed on the graph with a sparsity constraint, incorporating diversity information.

Automating readers' advisory to make book recommendations for K-12 readers,Maria Soledad Pera (Brigham Young University);Yiu-Kai Ng (Brigham Young University);,"2103578975,2135939557","The academic performance of students is affected by their reading ability, which explains why reading is one of the most important aspects of school curriculums. Promoting good reading habits among K-12 students is essential, given the enormous influence of reading on students' development as learners and members of society. In doing so, it is indispensable to provide readers with engaging and motivating reading selections. Unfortunately, existing book recommenders have failed to offer adequate choices for K-12 readers, since they either ignore the reading abilities of their users or cannot acquire the much-needed information to make recommendations due to privacy issues. To address these problems, we have developed Rabbit, a book recommender that emulates the readers' advisory service offered at school/public libraries. Rabbit considers the readability levels of its readers and determines the facets, i.e.,appeal factors, of books that evoke subconscious, emotional reactions on a reader. The design of Rabbit is unique, since it adopts a multi-dimensional approach to capture the reading abilities, preferences, and interests of its readers, which goes beyond the traditional book content/topical analysis.

The annual RecSys conference is the premier international forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to share their challenges, research results, and experiences in the broad field of recommender systems. RecSys 2014 features keynote talks, research paper presentations, industry sessions, poster sessions, workshops, tutorials, demonstrations, a doctoral symposium, and the RecSys Challenge. The success of a conference largely depends on the quality of the submitted works. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the authors for submitting their original research to Recsys 2014. The RecSys conference has seen remarkable growth since its inception as Recommenders 06 Summer School on the Present and Future of Recommender Systems. It has evolved into a full-fledged, top research conference since 2007, underscoring the increasing role and significant challenges related to recommender systems. This year we received a record number of 234 submissions and accepted 35 long papers for oral presentation (acceptance rate 23%) and 20 short papers for poster presentation (acceptance rate 24%). The RecSys conference is driven by real-world challenges. The key topics covered in this year's research program include ranking and top-n recommendations (7.5% of papers), matrix factorization (5.6%), cold start (5.6%), implicit feedback (4.3%), context awareness (3.6%), metrics and evaluation (3.5%), novel applications (2.9%), and more. The quality of a conference program also depends on the competence and hard work of its devoted volunteers. To select the 55 accepted papers out of the initial 234 submissions, this year, we implemented a two-tier review process, where each paper received detailed reviews from three program committee members, followed by a meta-review by a senior program committee member. Our entire committee involved 20 senior and 102 regular Program Committee members. We are extremely grateful to all the PC members for volunteering their time to generate more than 900 detailed and insightful reviews and discussions. In addition to the technical paper program, the program provides a diverse array of exciting venues for our attendees to interact with top experts from academia and industry on topics related to recommender systems. We are very fortunate to have three world-class keynote speakers this year spanning industry and academia, providing inspirational talks on cutting-edge challenges and directions in the field.

Deviation-based and similarity-based contextual SLIM recommendation algorithms,Yong Zheng (DePaul University);,2686358058,"Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) have been demonstrated to be able to enhance recommendations by adapting users' preferences to different contextual situations.

DCM is good for explanation but it may only work well on data sets with dense contextual ratings. Recently, we successfully incorporate contexts into Sparse LInear Method (SLIM) and develop contextual SLIM (CSLIM) recommendation algorithms which take advantages of both NBCF and MF.

Unfortunately, existing recommender systems are not designed for recommending user-generated item lists. In this work, we study properties of these user-generated item lists and propose a Bayesian ranking model, called LIRE for recommending them. The proposed model takes into consideration users' previous interactions with both item lists and with individual items. Furthermore, we propose in LIRE a novel way of weighting items within item lists based on both position of items, and personalized list consumption pattern. Through extensive experiments on a real item list dataset from Goodreads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LIRE model.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Browser-oriented universal cross-site recommendation and explanation based on user browsing logs,Yongfeng Zhang (Tsinghua University);,2712305564,"Our research aims to bridge the gap between different websites to provide cross-site recommendations based on browsers. Recent advances have made recommender systems essential to various online applications, such as e-commerce, social networks, and review service websites. However, practical systems mainly focus on recommending inner-site homogeneous items. For example, a movie review website usually recommends other movies within the site when a user has enjoyed a movie online. However, it would be exciting if the system recommends some attractive products related to this movie from some e-commerce websites like Amazon or eBay. Such an ability to provide heterogeneous cross-site recommendations may shed light on brand new and promising business models, which could benefit both the online shops in expanding the marketing efforts, and the online users in discovering items of interest from a wider scope. In this research, we propose and formalize the problem of universal recommendation, record and analyze user browsing actions in web browsers, and provide browser-oriented cross-site recommendations when the users are surfing online.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;matrix decomposition;recommender system;internet privacy;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;
Recommendation-based modeling support for data mining processes,Dietmar Jannach (Technical University of Dortmund);Simon Fischer;,"208543431,2476938171","RapidMiner is a software tool that allows users to define data mining processes based on a visual model and implements a variety of so-called ""operators"" for data extraction, manipulation, model learning and analysis. The large number of available operators can however make it challenging for the process designer to find the appropriate operators for the problem at hand. At the same time, some operators are only meaningful when combined with certain others. In this work, we evaluate different strategies of recommending additional operators to the user during the design of the process. The recommendation models are learned using a pool of several thousand existing data mining processes and evaluated in an offline experiment. The results indicate that good predictive accuracy can already be achieved with comparably simple co-occurrence based algorithms.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,process modeling;evaluation;recommender system;data science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Switching hybrid for cold-starting context-aware recommender systems,Matthias Braunhofer (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano);Victor Codina (Polytechnic University of Catalonia);Francesco Ricci (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano);,"47849064,2330369335,2146296306","Finding effective solutions for cold-starting Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARSs) is important because usually low quality recommendations are produced for users, items or contextual situations that are new to the system. In this paper, we tackle this problem with a switching hybrid solution that exploits a custom selection of two CARS algorithms, each one suited for a particular cold-start situation, and switches between these algorithms depending on the detected recommendation situation (new user, new item or new context). We evaluate the proposed algorithms in an off-line experiment by using various contextually-tagged rating datasets. We illustrate some significant performance differences between the considered algorithms and show that they can be effectively combined into the proposed switching hybrid to cope with different types of cold-start problems.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,cold start;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;simulation;computer science;
Modeling the effect of people's preferences and social forces on adopting and sharing items,Amit Sharma (Cornell University);,2513536541,"Recommender systems within social networks face three distinct challenges: suggesting what to consume/adopt, what to share and who to share it with. For all three cases, my and others' research work shows that people's decisions to adopt and share depend not only on their preferences for items, but also on social forces such as influence, conformity and identity management. Modeling the combined effects of people's preferences and social forces can lead to socially-aware recommender algorithms and interfaces as well more accurate models of information diffusion. I take a bottom-up approach to understanding how items are shared or adopted in a social network. First, I conduct behavioral experiments that give insights about, and allow to model the processes by which people decide to share or adopt items. Second, I use data from multiple social networking websites to validate and extend these models and develop tractable algorithms to predict people's decisions on items. This paper presents preliminary models for adoption and sharing along with future directions towards more accurate models. Results of my current work indicate that people consider their own preferences for items more than the recipients' when sharing and share only highly liked items. When adopting, people's preferences towards items matter, but so do annotations that accompany recommendations based on social influences; I show how their relative effects can be modeled as a mixture distribution.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,social network;world wide web;
The recommender problem revisited,Xavier Amatriain (Netflix);,2571014644,"In 2006, Netflix announced a $1M prize competition to advance recommendation algorithms. The recommendation problem was simplified as the accuracy in predicting a user rating measured by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). While that formulation helped get the attention of the research community in the area, it may have put an excessive focus on what is simply one of the many possible approaches to recommendations. In this tutorial we will describe different components of modern recommender systems such as: personalized ranking, similarity, explanations, context-awareness, or search as recommendation. We will use the Netflix use case as a driving example of a prototypical industrial-scale recommender system that has evolved from focusing on rating prediction to full page optimization. We will also review the usage of modern algorithmic approaches that include algorithms such as Factorization Machines [9], Restricted Boltzmann Machines [10], SimRank [7], Deep Neural Networks, or Listwise Learning-to-rank [6, 12, 11]. The original recommendation problem was formulated around the existence of explicit user ratings. However, recommender systems can be built using different kinds of data including implicit behavioral data, social connections, or demographics. In this tutorial we will review the usage of different data types and discuss what the availability of Big Data has brought into the research area. Finally, and also related to the availability of large quantities of data, we will talk about how system and architectural decisions play a role in understanding the recommender problem.

A parameter-free algorithm for an optimized tag recommendation list size,Modou Gueye (Cheikh Anta Diop University);Talel Abdessalem (Télécom ParisTech);Hubert Naacke (University of Paris);,"2311750175,319880114,1984766809","Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 1 . By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Enhancing personalization and learner engagement through context-aware recommendation in TEL,Betty Mayeku (University of Göttingen);,1913994057,"Providing a personalized learning experience that caters for individual learner's needs within the learner's context of use is crucial in achieving effective learning in a technology enhanced learning (TEL) environment. However, achieving personalization amidst diverse and rich environment within which learning takes place still remains a major challenge. Though adaption has been proposed to provide learners with learning experiences that are tailored to their particular educational needs, however, one of its limitation is user involvement. Absolute machine control is not always desirable considering the intellectual presence of human-beings. Furthermore learner engagement is one of crucial elements for realizing effective learning. Therefore, this study aims at exploring how context-awareness can support a personalized and engaged learning experience. The study in particular proposes the use of context-aware recommendation mechanism and the consideration of learner's preference to learning as approaches for achieving personalization and learner engagement.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,open learning;personalization;experiential learning;adaptation;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;

A framework for matrix factorization based on general distributions,Josef Bauer;Alexandros Nanopoulos (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki);,"2638500690,2076709237","In this paper we extend the current state-of-the-art matrix factorization method for recommendations to general probability distributions. As shown in previous work, the standard method called ""Probabilistic Matrix Factorization"" is based on a normal distribution assumption. While there exists work in which this method is extended to other distributions, these extensions are restrictive and we experimentally show on the basis of a real data set that it is worthwhile considering more general distributions which have not been used in the literature. Our contribution lies in providing a flexible and easy-to-use framework for matrix factorization with almost no limitation on the form of the distribution used. Our approach is based on maximum likelihood estimation and a key ingredient of our proposed method is automatic differentiation. This allows for the automatic derivation of the corresponding optimization algorithm, without the need to derive it manually for each distributional assumption while simultaneously being computationally efficient. Thus, with our method it is very easy to use a wide range of even complicated distributions for any data set.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,dixon s factorization method;automatic differentiation;matrix decomposition;maximum likelihood;machine learning;mathematical optimization;
Improving recommender systems: user roles and lifecycles,Tien T. Nguyen (University of Minnesota);,2251180714,"In the era of big data, it is usually agreed that the more data we have, the better results we can get. However, for some domains that heavily depend on user inputs (such as recommender systems), the performance evaluation metrics are sensitive to the amount of noise introduced by users. Such noise can be from users who only wanted to explore the systems, and thus did not spend efforts to provide accurate inputs. Noise can also be introduced by the methods of collecting user ratings. In my dissertation, I study how user data can affect prediction accuracies and performances of recommendation algorithms. To that end, I investigate how the data collection methods and the life cycles of users affect the prediction accuracies and the performance of recommendation algorithms.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,noise;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;

'Free lunch' enhancement for collaborative filtering with factorization machines,Babak Loni (Delft University of Technology);Alan Said (Delft University of Technology);Martha Larson (Delft University of Technology);Alan Hanjalic (Delft University of Technology);,"976610161,2104679579,2111809670,713704318","The advantage of Factorization Machines over other factorization models is their ability to easily integrate and efficiently exploit auxiliary information to improve Collaborative Filtering. Until now, this auxiliary information has been drawn from external knowledge sources beyond the user-item matrix. In this paper, we demonstrate that Factorization Machines can exploit additional representations of information inherent in the user-item matrix to improve recommendation performance. We refer to our approach as 'Free Lunch' enhancement since it leverages clusters that are based on information that is present in the user-item matrix, but not otherwise directly exploited during matrix factorization. Borrowing clustering concepts from codebook sharing, our approach can also make use of 'Free Lunch' information inherent in a user-item matrix from a auxiliary domain that is different from the target domain of the recommender. Our approach improves performance both in the joint case, in which the auxiliary and target domains share users, and in the disjoint case, in which they do not. Although 'Free Lunch' enhancement does not apply equally well to any given domain or domain combination, our overall conclusion is that Factorization Machines present an opportunity to exploit information that is ubiquitously present, but commonly under-appreciated by Collaborative Filtering algorithms.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;recommender system;theoretical computer science;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

A virtual profile is generated by representing an item in the user feature space and leveraging the overrepresented user features from users who interacted with the item. It is a way to think about Collaborative Filtering with content features. The core principle is that if the feature occurs with high probability for the users who interacted with an item (henceforth termed as relevant users) versus those who did not (henceforth termed as non-relevant users), then that feature is a good candidate to be included in the virtual profile of the item in question. However, this scheme suffers from the data imbalance problem because observed relevant users are usually an extremely small minority group compared to the whole user base. Feature selection in this skewed setting is prone to noise from the overwhelming non-relevant examples that belong to the majority group. To alleviate the problem, we propose a method to select the most relevant non-relevant examples from the majority group by segmenting users on certain intelligently selected feature dimensions. The resulting virtual profile from the method is called the segmented virtual profile .

A Hybrid Strategy for Privacy-Preserving Recommendations for Mobile Shopping,Toon De Pessemier (Ghent University);Kris Vanhecke (iMinds);Luc Martens (Ghent University);,"2302923081,2677210355,1986597048","To calculate recommendations, recommender systems collect and store huge amounts of users’ personal data such as preferences, interaction behavior, or demographic information. If these data are used for other purposes or get into the wrong hands, the privacy of the users can be compromised. Thus, service providers are confronted with the challenge of o↵ering accurate recommendations without the risk of dissemination of sensitive information. This paper presents a hybrid strategy combining collaborative filtering and content-based techniques for mobile shopping with the primary aim of preserving the customer’s privacy. Detailed information about the customer, such as the shopping history, is securely stored on the customer’s smartphone and locally processed by a content-based recommender. Data of individual shopping sessions, which are sent to the store backend for product association and comparison with similar customers, are unlinkable and anonymous. No uniquely identifying information of the customer is revealed, making it impossible to associate successive shopping sessions at the store backend. Optionally, the customer can disclose demographic data and a rudimentary explicit profile for further personalization.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,customer intelligence;internet privacy;world wide web;computer science;

Most recent research has focused on examining the added value of adding semantic features based on structured web data, in particular Linked Open Data (LOD). In this paper, we focus in contrast on semantic feature construction from text, by incorporating features based on semantic frames into a book recommendation classifier. To this purpose we leverage the semantic frames based on parsing the plots of the items under consideration with a state-of-the-art semantic parser. By investigating this type of semantic information, we show that these frames are also able to represent information about a particular book, but without the need of having explicitly structured data describing the books available. We reveal that exploiting frame information outperforms a basic bag-of-words approach and that especially the words relating to those frames are beneficial for classification. In a final step we compare and combine our system with the LOD features from a system leveraging DBpedia as knowledge resource. We show that both approaches yield similar results and reveal that combining semantic information from these two different sources might even be beneficial.",2014,Conference on Recommender Systems,semantic computing;social semantic web;semantic equivalence;semantic analytics;semantic grid;semantic technology;semantic integration;linked data;semantic similarity;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;

Using Markov chains, the probability distribution function over time can be estimated for each state, and thus, the probability that a recommendation is deleted from the list can be used to benchmark a recommender on its endurance and performance. An experimental set up is described that allows to test the presented method in an actual mobile application. The application of the method will allow to benchmark a variety of recommenders.

Recommendation of shopping places based on social and geographical influences,Romain Picot Clemente;Cécile Bothorel (École nationale supérieure des télécommunications de Bretagne);,"2109323438,98820614","The project tackled in this article is a shopping recommender system that aims at providing recommendations of new interesting shopping places to users, by considering their tastes and those of their friends, since social friends are often sharing common interests. This kind of system is a Location-Based Social Network. It considers social relationships and check-ins; i.e. the action of visiting a shopping place. In order to recommend shopping places, we are proposing a method combining three separated graphs, namely the social graph, the frequentation graph and a geographic graph into one graph. Hence, in this merged graph, nodes can represent users or places, and edges can connect users to each other (social links), users with places (frequentation relations) or places to each other (geographic relations). Given that check-in behavior of users is strongly dependent on the distances, the geographic graph is constructed considering the density of probabilities that a check-in is done according to its distance to the other check-ins. The Katz centrality is then used on the merged graph to compute the scores of candidate locations to be recommended. Finally, the top-n unvisited shopping places are recommended to the target user. The proposed method is compared to methods from the literature on a real-world datatset. The results confirm the real interest of considering both social and geographic data beyond the frequentations for recommending new places. Generally, our method outperforms significantly the compared methods, but under certain conditions that we analyze, we show it gives sometimes mixed results.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,recommender system;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;
Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text,Julian J. McAuley (Stanford University);Jure Leskovec (Stanford University);,"2041520510,1878631932","In order to recommend products to users we must ultimately predict how a user will respond to a new product. To do so we must uncover the implicit tastes of each user as well as the properties of each product. For example, in order to predict whether a user will enjoy Harry Potter, it helps to identify that the book is about wizards, as well as the user's level of interest in wizardry. User feedback is required to discover these latent product and user dimensions. Such feedback often comes in the form of a numeric rating accompanied by review text. However, traditional methods often discard review text, which makes user and product latent dimensions difficult to interpret, since they ignore the very text that justifies a user's rating. In this paper, we aim to combine latent rating dimensions (such as those of latent-factor recommender systems) with latent review topics (such as those learned by topic models like LDA). Our approach has several advantages. Firstly, we obtain highly interpretable textual labels for latent rating dimensions, which helps us to `justify' ratings with text. Secondly, our approach more accurately predicts product ratings by harnessing the information present in review text; this is especially true for new products and users, who may have too few ratings to model their latent factors, yet may still provide substantial information from the text of even a single review. Thirdly, our discovered topics can be used to facilitate other tasks such as automated genre discovery, and to identify useful and representative reviews.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,topic model;recommender system;data science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Previous work studied spatial and social influences on location recommendation in LBSNs. Due to the strong correlations between a user's check-in time and the corresponding check-in location, recommender systems designed for location recommendation inevitably need to consider temporal effects.

Spatial topic modeling in online social media for location recommendation,Bo Hu (Simon Fraser University);Martin Ester (Simon Fraser University);,"2509975690,2067196623","Mobile networks enable users to post on social media services (e.g., Twitter) from anywhere.

We propose the first ST (Spatial Topic) model to capture the correlation between users' movements and between user interests and the function of locations. We employ the sparse coding technique which greatly speeds up the learning process. We perform experiments on two real life data sets from Twitter and Yelp.

Hybrid event recommendation using linked data and user diversity,Houda Khrouf (Institut Eurécom);Raphaël Troncy (Institut Eurécom);,"1974621617,2108465849","An ever increasing number of social services offer thousands of diverse events per day. Users tend to be overwhelmed by the massive amount of information available, especially with limited browsing options perceived in many event web services. To alleviate this information overload, a recommender system becomes a vital component for assisting users selecting relevant events. However, such system faces a number of challenges owed to the the inherent complex nature of an event. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach built on top of Semantic Web. On the one hand, we use a content-based system enriched with Linked Data to overcome the data sparsity, a problem induced by the transiency of events. On the other hand, we incorporate a collaborative filtering to involve the social aspect, an influential feature in decision making. This hybrid system is enhanced by the integration of a user diversity model designed to detect user propensity towards specific topics.

However, most such studies only consider a single type of relationship, e.g., social network. Notice that in many applications, the recommendation problem exists in an attribute-rich heterogeneous information network environment. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. We propose to combine various relationship information from the network with user feedback to provide high quality recommendation results. The major challenge of building recommender systems in heterogeneous information networks is to systematically define features to represent the different types of relationships between entities, and learn the importance of each relationship type. In the proposed framework, we first use meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different paths in the related information network. We then define a recommendation model with such latent features and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the model.

Recent studies have shown that recommender systems have a positive effect on the provider's revenue. In this paper we show that by providing a set of recommendations different than the one perceived best according to user acceptance rate, the recommendation system can further increase the business' utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content. We performed a large body of experiments comparing a commercial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified recommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible reduce in satisfaction by providing the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Differences in user satisfaction between the lists is negligible, and not statistically significant.

More generally, when users interact with systems such as shopping websites or online radio, they click on items that are of interest in the current context. We call the sequence of clicks made in the current session interactional context . It is desirable for a recommender system to use the context set by the user to update recommendations. Most current context-aware recommender systems focus on a relatively less dynamic representational context defined by attributes such as season, location and tastes. In this paper, we study the problem of collaborative filtering with interactional context, where the goal is to make personalized and dynamic recommendations to a user engaged in a session. To this end, we propose the methodname algorithm that works in two stages. First, users are clustered by their transition behavior (one-step Markov transition probabilities between items), and cluster-level Markov models are computed. Then personalized PageRank is computed for a given user on the corresponding cluster Markov graph, with a personalization vector derived from the current context. We give an interpretation of the second stage of the algorithm as adding an appropriate context bias , in addition to click bias (or rating bias), to a classical neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model, where the neighborhood is determined from a Markov graph.

Xbox movies recommendations: variational bayes matrix factorization with embedded feature selection,Noam Koenigstein (Microsoft);Ulrich Paquet (Microsoft);,"281847691,1773006169","We present a matrix factorization model inspired by challenges we encountered while working on the Xbox movies recommendation system. The item catalog in a recommender system is typically equipped with meta-data features in the form of labels. However, only part of these features are informative or useful with regard to collaborative filtering. By incorporating a novel sparsity prior on feature parameters, the model automatically discerns and utilizes informative features while simultaneously pruning non-informative features. The model is designed for binary feedback, which is common in many real-world systems where numeric rating data is scarce or non-existent. However, the overall framework is applicable to any likelihood function. Model parameters are estimated with a Variational Bayes inference algorithm, which is robust to over-fitting and does not require cross-validation and fine tuning of regularization coefficients. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on a sample from the Xbox movies dataset as well as on the publicly available MovieLens dataset. In both cases, the proposed solution provides superior predictive accuracy, especially for long-tail items. We then demonstrate the feature selection capabilities and compare against the common case of simple Gaussian priors. Finally, we show that even without features, our model performs better than a baseline model trained with the popular stochastic gradient descent approach.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,recommender system;world wide web;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;

When the pages matching the user's original keywords are judged to be unsatisfactory, query recommendation techniques are used to propose alternative queries and alter the result set. These techniques search for queries that are semantically similar to the user's original query, often searching for keywords that are similar to the keywords given by the user. However, when the original query is sufficiently ill-posed, the user's informational need is best met using entirely different keywords, and a substantially different query may be necessary. We propose a novel approach that is not based on the keywords of the original query. We intentionally seek out orthogonal queries , which are related queries that have (almost) no common terms with the user's query. This allows an orthogonal query to satisfy the user's informational need when small perturbations of the original keyword set are insufficient.

Burke (DePaul University);,"2058044039,1892801027,2122091461","Context aware recommender systems go beyond the traditional personalized recommendation models by incorporating a form of situational awareness. They provide recommendations that not only correspond to a user's preference profile, but that are also tailored to a given situation or context. We consider the setting in which contextual information is represented as a subset of an item feature space describing short-term interests or needs of a user in a given situation. This contextual information can be provided by the user in the form of an explicit query, or derived implicitly. We propose a unified probabilistic model that integrates user profiles, item representations, and contextual information. The resulting recommendation framework computes the conditional probability of each item given the user profile and the additional context. These probabilities are used as recommendation scores for ranking items. Our model is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that provides the capability for joint modeling of users, items, and the meta-data associated with contexts. Each user profile is modeled as a mixture of the latent topics. The discovered latent topics enable our system to handle missing data in item features. We demonstrate the application of our framework for article and music recommendation. In the latter case, the set of popular tags from social tagging Web sites are used for context descriptions.

Evaluation of recommendations: rating-prediction and ranking,Harald Steck (Netflix);,2304435512,"The literature on recommender systems distinguishes typically between two broad categories of measuring recommendation accuracy: rating prediction, often quantified in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), and ranking, measured in terms of metrics like precision and recall, among others. In this paper, we examine both approaches in detail, and find that the dominating difference lies instead in the training and test data considered: rating prediction is concerned with only the observed ratings, while ranking typically accounts for all items in the collection, whether the user has rated them or not. Furthermore, we show that predicting observed ratings, while popular in the literature, only solves a (small) part of the rating prediction task for any item in the collection, which is a common real-world problem. The reasons are selection bias in the data, combined with data sparsity. We show that the latter rating-prediction task involves the prediction task 'Who rated What' as a sub-problem, which can be cast as a classification or ranking problem. This suggests that solving the ranking problem is not only valuable by itself, but also for predicting the rating value of any item.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,ranking svm;ranking;selection bias;recommender system;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Hence, the variety of a user's interests could be better captured by a more complex representation. We propose to model the user with a richer set of functions, specifically via a set of latent vectors, where each vector captures one of the user's latent interests or tastes. The overall recommendation model is then nonlinear where the matching score between a user and a given item is the maximum matching score over each of the user's latent interests with respect to the item's latent representation.

Evolving friend lists in social networks,Jacob W. Bartel (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill);Prasun Dewan (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill);,"2227301448,2159107207","In a social network, users can sort members of their social graph into friend lists to both understand the social structures within the graph and control the flow of incoming and outgoing information. To reduce the user-effort required to create these lists, previous work has developed techniques for generating friend-lists in a static social graph. This paper considers the user effort required to create friend lists in an evolving graph. We have developed several new initial quantitative metrics to capture this effort, and identified an initial technique for modeling graph growth. We have used these metrics and model to compare two techniques for evolving friend lists when the social graph grows: manual evolution - the user evolves friend lists using no external tools -- and full recommendation -- an existing state of the art tool recommends a whole new set of friend lists. In these comparisons, we used the friend lists of 12 individuals, and simulated the growth of their social graphs and friend lists using our graph-growth model. Intuitively, when the graph evolves by a small (large) amount, the manual (automatic) approach should perform better. Our experiments show that full recommendation performs better than manual when the social graph changes by more than 1%, and yields an almost complete reduction in effort in the best cases.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,evolution;world wide web;data mining;artificial intelligence;computer science;

While item-oriented systems are central in their importance, they have been approached so far using very basic tools. We identify several hurdles faced by standard approaches to the item-oriented task. First, the sparseness of observed activities prevents establishing reliable similarity relations for many item pairs. Second, we address a scalability challenge at the retrieval stage present in many real-world systems: Given an item inventory, which may encompass millions of items, it is desired to identify the most related item pairs in a sub-quadratic time.

Helpful reviews are usually buried in a large number of unhelpful reviews, and with the consistently increasing number of reviews, it becomes more and more difficult for online users to find helpful reviews. Therefore most online review websites allow online users to rate the helpfulness of a review and a global helpfulness score is computed for the review based on its available ratings. However, in reality, user-specified helpfulness ratings for reviews are very sparse - a few reviews attract large numbers of helpfulness ratings while most reviews obtain few or even no helpfulness ratings. The available helpfulness ratings are too sparse for online users to assess the helpfulness of reviews. Also the helpfulness of a review is not necessarily equally useful for all users and users with different background may treat the helpfulness of a review very differently. The user idiosyncracy of review helpfulness motivates us to study the problem of review helpfulness rating prediction in this paper.

To personalize or not: a risk management perspective,Weinan Zhang (University College London);Jun Wang (University College London);Bowei Chen (University College London);Xiaoxue Zhao (University College London);,"2527611484,2557836567,2224779522,2222264431","Personalization techniques have been widely adopted in many recommender systems. However, experiments on real-world datasets show that for some users in certain contexts, personalized recommendations do not necessarily perform better than recommendations that rely purely on popularity. Broadly, this can be interpreted by the fact that the parameters of a personalization model are usually estimated from sparse data; the resulting personalized prediction, despite of its low bias, is often volatile. In this paper, we study the problem further by investigating into the ranking of recommendation lists. From a risk management and portfolio retrieval perspective, there is no difference between the popularity-based and the personalized ranking as both of the recommendation outputs can be represented as the trade-off between expected relevance (reward) and associated uncertainty (risk). Through our analysis, we discover common scenarios and provide a technique to predict whether personalization will fail. Besides the theoretical understanding, our experimental results show that the resulting switch algorithm, which decides whether or not to personalize, outperforms the mainstream recommendation algorithms.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,personalization;collaborative filtering;modern portfolio theory;recommender system;knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Nevertheless, different users may be interested in the same object for different reasons---for instance, the Star Wars movies may appeal to both adventure as well as to fantasy movie fans. In this situation, a sensible strategy is to provide a user with diverse recommendations of how to tag the object. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending relevant and diverse tags as a ranking problem. In particular, we propose a novel tag recommendation approach that explicitly takes into account the possible topics (e.g., categories) underlying an object in order to promote tags with high coverage and low redundancy with respect to these topics. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed approach using data collected from two popular Web 2.0 applications, namely, LastFM and MovieLens. Our experimental results attest the effectiveness of our approach at promoting more relevant and diverse tags in contrast to state-of-the-art relevance-based methods as well as a recently proposed method that takes both relevance and diversity into account.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,relevance;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

Toward identification and adoption of best practices in algorithmic recommender systems research,Joseph A. Konstan (University of Minnesota);Gediminas Adomavicius (University of Minnesota);,"2002483998,1988164005","One of the goals of data-intensive research, in any field of study, is to grow knowledge over time as additional studies contribute to collective knowledge and understanding. Two steps are critical to making such research cumulative -- the individual research results need to be documented thoroughly and conducted on data made available to others (to allow replication and meta-analysis), and the individual research needs to be carried out correctly, following standards and best practices for coding, missing data, algorithm choices, algorithm implementations, metrics, and statistics. This work aims to address a growing concern that the Recommender Systems research community (which is uniquely equipped to address many important challenges in electronic commerce, social networks, social media, and big data settings) is facing a crisis where a significant number of research papers lack the rigor and evaluation to be properly judged and, therefore, have little to contribute to collective knowledge. We advocate that this issue can be addressed through development and dissemination (to authors, reviewers, and editors) of best-practice research methodologies, resulting in specific guidelines and checklists, as well as through tool development to support effective research. We also plan to assess the impact on the field with an eye toward supporting such efforts in other data-intensive specialties.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,evaluation;recommender system;management science;knowledge management;world wide web;computer science;

Every user is encountered by the system just once, receives a recommendation, and either consumes or ignores it, registering a binary reward. We introduce One-pass Factorization of Feature Sets, 'OFF-Set', a novel recommendation algorithm based on Latent Factor analysis, which models users by mapping their features to a latent space.

Pairwise learning in recommendation: experiments with community recommendation on linkedin,Amit Sharma (Cornell University);Baoshi Yan (LinkedIn);,"2513536541,2104629786","Many online systems present a list of recommendations and infer user interests implicitly from clicks or other contextual actions. For modeling user feedback in such settings, a common approach is to consider items acted upon to be relevant to the user, and irrelevant otherwise. However, clicking some but not others conveys an implicit ordering of the presented items. Pairwise learning, which leverages such implicit ordering between a pair of items, has been successful in areas such as search ranking. In this work, we study whether pairwise learning can improve community recommendation. We first present two novel pairwise models adapted from logistic regression. Both offline and online experiments in a large real-world setting show that incorporating pairwise learning improves the recommendation performance. However, the improvement is only slight. We find that users' preferences regarding the kinds of communities they like can differ greatly, which adversely affect the effectiveness of features derived from pairwise comparisons. We therefore propose a probabilistic latent semantic indexing model for pairwise learning (Pairwise PLSI), which assumes a set of users' latent preferences between pairs of items. Our experiments show favorable results for the Pairwise PLSI model and point to the potential of using pairwise learning for community recommendation.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,potentially all pairwise rankings of all possible alternatives;pairwise comparison;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

In this paper, we start exploring this topic by investigating if a user's social media profile can be used to predict and recommend what type of products and what brands the social user is more likely to buy. More specifically, we study the correlation between the brands liked by the user on social media sites and those purchased on an e-commerce site.

The retargeting is combined with an underlying matrix factorization regression model that couples the user-wise rankings to exploit shared low dimensional structure. We show that R-MF recovers a unique solution under mild conditions, and propose a simple and efficient optimization scheme that alternates between retargeting the ratings subject to ordering constraints, and matrix factorization regression. The retargeting step is independent for each user, and is trivially parallelized. The ranking performance of retargeted matrix factorization is evaluated on benchmark movie recommendation datasets and results in superior ranking performance compared to collaborative filtering algorithms specifically designed to optimize ranking metrics.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;matrix decomposition;learning to rank;theoretical computer science;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

"Trading-off among accuracy, similarity, diversity, and long-tail: a graph-based recommendation approach",Lei Shi (Baidu);,2651655760,"Improving recommendation accuracy is the mostly focused target of recommendation systems, while it has been increasingly recognized that accuracy is not enough as the only quality criterion. More concepts have been proposed recently to augment the evaluation dimensions, such as similarity, diversity, long-tail, etc. Simultaneously considering multiple criteria leads to a multi-task recommendation. In this paper, a graph-based recommendation approach is proposed to effectively and flexibly trade-off among them. Our approach is considered based a 1st order Markovian graph with transition probabilities between user-item pairs. A ""cost flow"" concept is proposed over the graph, so that items with lower costs are stronger recommended to a user. The cost flows are formulated in a recursive dynamic form, whose stability is proved to be guaranteed by appropriately lower-bounding the transition costs. Furthermore, a mixture of transition costs is designed by combining three ingredients related to long-tail, focusing degree and similarity. To evaluate the ingredients, we propose an orthogonal-sparse-orthogonal nonnegative matrix tri-factorization model and an efficient multiplicative algorithm. Empirical experiments on real-world data show promising results of our approach, which could be regarded as a general framework for other affects if transition costs are designed in various ways.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,contraction mapping;collaborative filtering;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;

What to read next?: making personalized book recommendations for K-12 users,Maria Soledad Pera (Brigham Young University);Yiu-Kai Ng (Brigham Young University);,"2103578975,2135939557","Finding books that children/teenagers are interested in these days is a non-trivial task due to the diversity of topics covered in huge volumes of books with varied readability levels. Even though K-12 readers can turn to book recommenders to look for books, the recommended books may not satisfy their personal needs, since they could be beyond/below their readability levels or fail to match their topics of interest. To address these problems, we introduce BReK12, a book recommender that makes personalized suggestions tailored to each K-12 user U based on books available on a social book-marking site that (i) are similar in content to the ones that are known to be of interest to U, (ii) have been bookmarked by users with reading patterns similar to U's, and (iii) can be comprehended by U. BReK12 is an asset to its users, since it suggests books that are appealing to its users and at grade levels that they can cope with, which can increase their reading selection choices and motivate them to read. We have also developed ReLAT, the readability analysis tool employed by BReK12 to determine the grade level of books. ReLAT is novel, compared with existing readability formulas, since it can predict the grade level of a book even if an excerpt of the book is not available. We have conducted empirical studies which have verified the accuracy of ReLAT in predicting the grade level of a book and the effectiveness of BReK12 over existing baseline recommendation systems.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,multimedia;world wide web;computer science;

Simulating random walks on a graph which fits in memory is trivial, but massive graphs pose a problem: the latency of following walks across network in a cluster or loading nodes from disk on-demand renders basic random walk simulation unbearably inefficient. In this work we propose DrunkardMob, a new algorithm for simulating hundreds of millions, or even billions, of random walks on massive graphs, on just a single PC or laptop. Instead of simulating one walk a time it processes millions of them in parallel, in a batch. Based on DrunkardMob and GraphChi we further propose a framework for easily expressing scalable algorithms based on graph walks.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,random graph;random walk;recommender system;theoretical computer science;computer science;

Accuracy and robustness impacts of power user attacks on collaborative recommender systems,Carlos E. Seminario (University of North Carolina at Charlotte);,2145590328,"Power users, in a Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender System (RS) context, are those who can exert considerable influence over the recommendation outcomes presented to other users. RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities and leverage them to help fellow users make informed purchase decisions. Thus, RS research in this area has focused on power user selection and utilization to address challenges such as rating sparsity for new items or users. But, as ever, there remains the potential for corruption by power users who provide biased ratings. And because of the influence that power users wield, biased ratings they provide can have significant impacts on RS accuracy and robustness. In order to better understand this problem and develop solution strategies, our research is investigating the impact on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists when power users provide biased ratings. The open areas of research we have explored are analyzing and evaluating power user selection techniques, statistically characterizing power users in order to create attack profiles, mounting power user attacks on new items, and using accuracy and robustness metrics to evaluate power user attacks. In the future, we plan to extend our initial research in power user selection, characterization, and evaluation, as well as generate attack profiles based on power user characteristics, mount power user attacks on user-based, item-based, and SVD-based CF systems, evaluate power user attacks, and generalize our work across different domains.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,evaluation;recommender system;world wide web;computer security;data mining;computer science;

A typical approach to increase revenue is to send email messages featuring the deals of the day. Such daily messages, however, are usually not centered on the customers, instead, all registered users typically receive similar messages with almost the same deals. Traditional recommendation algorithms are innocuous in DDSs because: (i) most of the users are sporadic bargain hunters, and thus past preference data is extremely sparse, (ii) deals have a short living period, and thus data is extremely volatile, and (iii) user taste and interest may undergo temporal drifts. In order to address such particularly challenging scenario, we propose new algorithms for daily deals recommendation based on the explore-then-exploit strategy.Users are split into exploration and exploitation sets -- in the exploration set the users receive non-personalized messages and a co-purchase network is updated with user feedback for purchases of the day, while in the exploitation set the updated network is used for recommending personalized messages for the remaining users.A thorough evaluation of our algorithms using real data obtained from a large daily deals website in Brazil in contrast to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms show gains in precision ranging from 18% to 34%.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,world wide web;

Unlike item-based collaborative filtering, we focus on discovering the characteristic descriptors that underlie the item-user association. Such information is used as supplemental features in a content-based filtering system. The main objective of virtual profiles is to provide a means to tap into rich-content information from one type of entity and propagate features extracted from which to other affiliated entities that may suffer from relative data scarcity. We empirically evaluate the proposed method on a real-world community recommendation problem at LinkedIn. The result shows that the virtual profiles outperform a collaborative filtering based approach (user who likes this also likes that).

We then interpret these ratings in an innovative way, using them to guide a Bayesian updating process that helps us both capture a user's current mood, and maintain her overall user type. We produced several variants of our approach, and applied them in the movie recommendations domain, evaluating them on data from the MovieLens dataset.

The result is important for the system owner to determine which data is useful to make the recommendation accurately. While there have been some related studies on the time dependency of data quality using neighbor-based CF methods (e.g., [4]), its effects remain unverified for other CF methods. In this paper, we study the effect of data generated over different time period on recommendation precision using several popular model-based CF algorithms (latent factor models). experiment results show that while more recent data expectedly have larger impacts, the usefulness of older data cannot be ignored as long as there are sufficient old samples.

Anytime algorithms for top-N recommenders,David Ben-Shimon (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev);,2559506620,"Many small and mid-sized e-businesses use the services of recommender system (RS) provider companies to outsource the construction and maintenance of their RS. The fees that RS providers charge their clients must cover the computation costs for constructing and updating the recommendation model. By using anytime algorithms, a RS provider can control the computation costs and still offer a system capable of delivering reasonable recommendations. Thus, a RS provider should be able to stop the construction of a recommendation model once the cost for compu-ting it reaches the amount the customer has agreed to pay. In this research we suggest anytime algorithms as a possible solu-tion to a problem that RS providers face.

The advantage over learning methods such as coordinate descent/alternating least-squares (ALS) or (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD) is that MCMC takes uncertainty into account and moreover MCMC can easily integrate priors to learn regularization values. For factorization models, MCMC inference can be done with efficient Gibbs samplers. However, MCMC algorithms are not point estimators, but they generate a chain of models. The whole chain of models is used to calculate predictions. For large scale models like factorization methods with millions or billions of model parameters, saving the whole chain of models is very storage intensive and can even get infeasible in practice. In this paper, we address this problem and show how a small subset from the chain of models can approximate the predictive distribution well. We use the fact that models from the chain are correlated and propose online selection techniques to store only a small subset of the models. We perform an empirical analysis on the large scale Netflix dataset with several Bayesian factorization models, including matrix factorization and SVD++.

An improved data aggregation strategy for group recommendations,Toon De Pessemier (Ghent University);Simon Dooms (iMinds);Luc Martens (Ghent University);,"2302923081,1858158954,1986597048","Although most recommender systems make suggestions for individual users, in many circumstances the selected items (e.g., movies) are not intended for personal usage but rather for consumption in group. Group recommendations can assist a group of users in nding and selecting interesting items thereby considering the tastes of all group members. Traditionally, group recommendations are generated either by aggregating the group members’ recommendations into a list of group recommendations or by aggregating the group members’ preferences (as expressed by ratings) into a group model, which is then used to calculate group recommendations. This paper presents a new data aggregation strategy for generating group recommendations by combining the two existing aggregation strategies. The proposed aggregation strategy outperforms each individual strategy for dierent sizes of the group and in combination with various recommendation algorithms.",2013,Conference on Recommender Systems,management science;knowledge management;data mining;computer science;
"""get lost, GetLostBot!"": annoying people by offering recommendations when they are not wanted",Ben Kirman (University of Lincoln);,2143855365,"This brief paper outlines the experience of releasing a purposefully contrary recommendation service for Foursquare called GetLostBot. GetLostBot works differently than most recommender systems since it is responsive to behaviours rather than user requests. The system automatically monitors Foursquare behaviour and intervenes with suggestions when users fall into a routine. These interventions take the form of mysterious walking directions that challenge the user to visit somewhere new. Importantly, these suggestions are explicitly not informed by traditional metrics such as popularity, high ratings, or friend activity, and instead act as prompts to explore unknown places. This paper discusses the reception to the application, highlighting the apparent disconnect between users' good intentions around becoming more serendipitous, and the reality of those interventions as they are experienced in the wild.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,intervention;multimedia;world wide web;simulation;

Simulating user intervention for interactive semantic place recognition with mobile devices,Tom Lovett (University of Bath);Eamonn O'Neill (University of Bath);,"2137428102,2131547447","Recognising and learning users' semantically meaningful places is useful for personalising services and recommender systems, particularly in a mobile environment. Existing approaches that use mobile devices focus on automating place inference from underlying data, i.e. with little user interaction and intervention -- where user feedback is incorporated into the inference process. The process of intervention can be burdensome to the user but, without intervention, it is difficult to both capture personal place semantics and update places over time; resulting in a trade-off between system performance and user burden. In this paper, we present early results from a place recognition and learning approach that relies on user intervention as a form of active learning. Using simulations of user intervention generated from fine-grained ground truth, we show that good place semantic capture, classification and learning performance can feasibly be achieved in real time on mobile devices with only a small amount of user intervention.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,user interface design;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

The growing popularity of location-enabled mobile phones and location-based services offers a great opportunity to apply personalization and recommender system technology to people's everyday lives. Personalization and recommender systems can be used to recommend new places and events that users may find interesting to visit, but, more broadly, these technologies can be used to personalize and enhance any service that people find themselves using. But how do we model such behaviors, what type of innovative applications, interfaces and interactions can we design, what types of content can we recommend and how do we engage, persuade and incentivize users while on-the-move? Location-based recommendations are everywhere. Recommendations for local places, things, and even people nearby are now standard practice across many commercial services; mobile ads, Google mobile search, foursquare recommendations, Yelp, Tripadvisor, etc. But how well are these actually suited to people's local needs? And how much fun is it to explore the world through the lens of recommendations? Our active RecSys 2012 workshop program explores local mobile experiences from two directions. First, we examine the role of personalization and recommendation in local mobile applications through interactive presentations and discussions by technical paper authors. Second, we'll spend half a day exploring Dublin using local recommender systems, on-the-spot. We'll be using commercial systems, and any services that participants themselves may have built -- and we'll explore what's great, what's missing, and where our research should be heading. The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and developers from both academia and industry to exchange experiences, insights and strategies in (1) personalizing local mobile applications and (2) generating local recommendations that fit local user needs. We aim to generate an overview of local considerations that can be applied by both researchers and practitioners in their work, to spur on future research and to have fun! We hope that the workshop proceedings and learning outcomes from the outdoor activity will serve as a valuable, thought-provoking resource for designers, researchers and developers working within the local mobile recommendation space.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,human computer interaction;multimedia;world wide web;
Design of a personalized navigation support system for context-aware ubiquitous learning environment,Chuang-Kai Chiou (Chung Hua University);Judy C.R. Tseng (Chung Hua University);,"2416940249,2116056793","In context-aware ubiquitous learning environment, finding out an optimal learning path for each student in real time to maximize the learning performance is important. In addition, many studies also indicated and confirmed that personalization is effective in improving the learning efficacy of students. Although the issue of personalized navigation support has been widely discussed in e-learning, it is still under investigated in ubiquitous learning environment. This paper proposes a personalized navigation strategy based on the Learning Orientation Theory. The strategy will guide the learners in context-aware ubiquitous learning environment by their learning orientation. To fulfill the proposed strategy, three navigation modes, namely Hyper-linear Navigation, Semi-linear Navigation, and Linear Navigation are developed for Transforming, Performing and Conforming learners respectively. A personalized navigation support system that includes the three navigation modes is also implemented.

Past work on Collaborative Filtering (CF) has either not addressed the ranking problem for binary relevance datasets, or not specifically focused on improving top-k recommendations. To solve the problem we propose a new CF approach, Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering (CLiMF). In CLiMF the model parameters are learned by directly maximizing the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which is a well-known information retrieval metric for measuring the performance of top-k recommendations. We achieve linear computational complexity by introducing a lower bound of the smoothed reciprocal rank metric.

RMFX is particularly suitable for large scale applications and experiments on the ""476 million Twitter tweets"" dataset show that our online approach largely outperforms recommendations based on Twitter's global trend, and it is also able to deliver highly competitive Top-N recommendations faster while using less space than Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF), a state-of-the-art matrix factorization technique for Collaborative Filtering, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,social web;ranking;active learning;collaborative filtering;matrix decomposition;data science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Context-aware music recommendation based on latenttopic sequential patterns,Negar Hariri (DePaul University);Bamshad Mobasher (DePaul University);Robin D. Burke (DePaul University);,"2058044039,1892801027,2122091461","Contextual factors can greatly influence the users' preferences in listening to music. Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discovered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to post-filter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;machine learning;computer science;

Here we address this list curation process from a recommender systems perspective. We propose a variety of criteria for generating user list recommendations, based on content analysis, network analysis, and the ""crowdsourcing"" of existing user lists. We demonstrate that these types of criteria are often only successful for datasets with certain characteristics.

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on improving the accuracy of top-k recommendation using social networks. We first show that the existing social-trust enhanced Matrix Factorization (MF) models can be tailored for top-k recommendation by including observed and missing ratings in their training objective functions. We also propose a Nearest Neighbor (NN) based top-k recommendation method that combines users' neighborhoods in the trust network with their neighborhoods in the latent feature space. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that social networks can significantly improve the top-k hit ratio, especially for cold start users.

Reviews written by other travelers replace the word-of-mouth, yet turn the search into a time consuming task. Users do not rate enough hotels to enable a collaborative filtering based recommendation.

We define context groups based on reviews extracted from TripAdvisor.com and Venere.com. We introduce a novel weighted algorithm for text mining. Our algorithm imitates a user that favors reviews written with the same trip intent and from people of similar background (nationality) and with similar preferences for hotel aspects, which are our defined context groups. Our approach combines numerous elements, including unsupervised clustering to build a vocabulary for hotel aspects, semantic analysis to understand sentiment towards hotel features, and the profiling of intent and nationality groups.

Alternating least squares for personalized ranking,Gábor Takács (Széchenyi István University);Domonkos Tikk (Óbuda University);,"2652277401,165729861","Two flavors of the recommendation problem are the explicit and the implicit feedback settings. In the explicit feedback case, users rate items and the user-item preference relationship can be modelled on the basis of the ratings. In the harder but more common implicit feedback case, the system has to infer user preferences from indirect information: presence or absence of events, such as a user viewed an item. One approach for handling implicit feedback is to minimize a ranking objective function instead of the conventional prediction mean squared error. The naive minimization of a ranking objective function is typically expensive. This difficulty is usually overcome by a trade-off: sacrificing the accuracy to some extent for computational efficiency by sampling the objective function. In this paper, we present a computationally effective approach for the direct minimization of a ranking objective function, without sampling. We demonstrate by experiments on the Y!Music and Netflix data sets that the proposed method outperforms other implicit feedback recommenders in many cases in terms of the ErrorRate, ARP and Recall evaluation metrics.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,ranking;collaborative filtering;mean squared error;data mining;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;

Less attention, however, has been paid to understanding what these strengths and failure modes are. Understanding what causes particular recommenders to fail will facilitate better selection of the component recommenders for future hybrid systems and a better understanding of how individual recommender personalities can be harnessed to improve the recommender user experience.

Multiple objective optimization in recommender systems,Mario Rodriguez (LinkedIn);Christian Posse (LinkedIn);Ethan Zhang (LinkedIn);,"2557232497,2288969707,2225894420","We address the problem of optimizing recommender systems for multiple relevance objectives that are not necessarily aligned. Specifically, given a recommender system that optimizes for one aspect of relevance, semantic matching (as defined by any notion of similarity between source and target of recommendation; usually trained on CTR), we want to enhance the system with additional relevance signals that will increase the utility of the recommender system, but that may simultaneously sacrifice the quality of the semantic match. The issue is that semantic matching is only one relevance aspect of the utility function that drives the recommender system, albeit a significant aspect. In talent recommendation systems, job posters want candidates who are a good match to the job posted, but also prefer those candidates to be open to new opportunities. Recommender systems that recommend discussion groups must ensure that the groups are relevant to the users' interests, but also need to favor active groups over inactive ones. We refer to these additional relevance signals (job-seeking intent and group activity) as extraneous features, and they account for aspects of the utility function that are not captured by the semantic match (i.e. post-CTR down-stream utilities that reflect engagement: time spent reading, sharing, commenting, etc). We want to include these extraneous features into the recommendations, but we want to do so while satisfying the following requirements: 1) we do not want to drastically sacrifice the quality of the semantic match, and 2) we want to quantify exactly how the semantic match would be affected as we control the different aspects of the utility function. In this paper, we present an approach that satisfies these requirements. We frame our approach as a general constrained optimization problem and suggest ways in which it can be solved efficiently by drawing from recent research on optimizing non-smooth rank metrics for information retrieval. Our approach features the following characteristics: 1) it is model and feature agnostic, 2) it does not require additional labeled training data to be collected, and 3) it can be easily incorporated into an existing model as an additional stage in the computation pipeline. We validate our approach in a revenue-generating recommender system that ranks billions of candidate recommendations on a daily basis and show that a significant improvement in the utility of the recommender system can be achieved with an acceptable and predictable degradation in the semantic match quality of the recommendations.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,weed control;satisfiability;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

In this paper, we propose a simple and effective local implicit feedback model mining users' local preferences to get better recommendation performance in both rating and ranking prediction. Moreover, we design an efficient training algorithm to speed up the updating procedure, and give a method to find the most appropriate time granularity to assist the performance.

Discovering latent factors from movies genres for enhanced recommendation,Marcelo Garcia Manzato (University of São Paulo);,1702574878,"Current approaches on collaborative filtering factorize user-item matrices in order to infer latent factors from ratings previously assigned by users. However, they all have to deal with sparseness, whose workarounds are prone to bias and/or overfitting. This paper proposes a recommender algorithm that is based on a factorized matrix composed of user preferences associated to the movies' genres/categories. The advantage of using such user-genre matrix factorization model is that it requires less computational resources, as the matrix will be less sparse and at lower dimension.

In that context, several authors have proposed to consider missing ratings as some form of negative feedback to compensate for the skewed distribution of observed ratings when users choose the items they rate. In this work, we study two major biases of the selection of items: the first one is that some items obtain more ratings than others (popularity effect), and the second one is that positive ratings are observed more frequently than negative ratings (positivity effect). We present a theoretical analysis and experiments on the Yahoo! dataset with randomly selected items, which show that considering missing data as a form of negative feedback during training may improve performances, but also that it can be misleading when testing, favoring models of popularity more than models of user preferences.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,ranking;skewness;negative feedback;missing data;evaluation;recommender system;data mining;

Ads and the city: considering geographic distance goes a long way,Diego Saez-Trumper (Pompeu Fabra University);Daniele Quercia (University of Cambridge);Jon Crowcroft (University of Cambridge);,"2084963834,2714967879,1970640687","Social-networking sites have started to offer tools that suggest ""guests"" who should be invited to user-defined social events (e.g., birthday parties, networking events). The problem of how to recommend people to events is similar to the more traditional (recommender system) problem of how to recommend events (items) to people (users). Yet, upon Foursquare data of ""who visits what"" in the city of London, we show that a state-of-the-art recommender system does not perform well -mainly because of data sparsity. To fix this problem, we add domain knowledge to the recommendation process. From the complex system literature in human mobility, we learn two insights: 1) there are special individuals (often called power users) who visit many places; and 2) individuals go to a venue not only because they like it but also because they are close-by. We model these insights into two simple models and learn that: 1) simply recommending power users works better than random but is far from producing the best recommendations; 2) an item-based recommender system produces accurate recommendations; and 3) recommending places that are closest to a user's geographic center of interest produces recommendations that are as accurate as, if not more accurate than, item-based recommender's.

In this paper, the possibility of performing collaborative filtering while attaching weights or quality scores to the ratings is explored. The quality scores, which are determined from the corresponding review data are used to ""up-weight"" or ""down-weight"" the importance given to the individual rating while performing collaborative filtering, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictions. First, the measure used to capture the quality of the ratings is described. Different approaches for estimating the quality score based on the available review information are examined.

Building industrial-scale real-world recommender systems,Xavier Amatriain (Netflix);,2571014644,"In 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, a machine learning and data mining competition for movie rating prediction. We offered $1 million to whoever improved the accuracy of our existing system called Cinematch by 10%. We conducted this competition to find new ways to improve the recommendations we provide to our members, which is a key part of our business. However, we had to come up with a proxy question that was easier to evaluate and quantify: the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted rating. A year into the competition, the Korbell team won the first Progress Prize with an 8.43% improvement. They reported more than 2000 hours of work in order to come up with the final combination of 107 algorithms that gave them this prize. And, they gave us the source code. We looked at the two underlying algorithms with the best performance in the ensemble. To put these algorithms to use, we had to work to overcome some limitations, for instance that they were built to handle 100 million ratings, instead of the more than 5 billion that we have, and that they were not built to adapt as members added more ratings. But once we overcame those challenges, we put the two algorithms into production, where they are still used as part of our recommendation engine. You might be wondering what happened with the final Grand Prize ensemble that won the $1M two years later. This is a truly impressive compilation and culmination of years of work, blending hundreds of predictive models to finally cross the finish line. We evaluated some of the new methods offline but the additional accuracy gains that we measured did not seem to justify the engineering effort needed to bring them into a production environment. This example highlights the fact that, besides improving offline metrics such as the RMSE, recommender systems need to take into account other practical issues such as scalability or deployment. In this tutorial, we go over some of those practical issues that many times are as important as the theory, if not more, in order to build an industrial-scale real-world recommender system.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,source code;mean squared error;predictive modelling;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

Other important and increasingly evident objectives are novelty and diversity, which are achieved by recommender systems that are able to suggest diversified items not easily discovered by the users. Different recommendation algorithms have particular strengths and weaknesses when it comes to each of these objectives, motivating the construction of hybrid approaches. However, most of these approaches only focus on optimizing accuracy, with no regard for novelty and diversity. The problem of combining recommendation algorithms grows significantly harder when multiple objectives are considered simultaneously. For instance, devising multi-objective recommender systems that suggest items that are simultaneously accurate, novel and diversified may lead to a conflicting-objective problem, where the attempt to improve an objective further may result in worsening other competing objectives. In this paper we propose a hybrid recommendation approach that combines existing algorithms which differ in their level of accuracy, novelty and diversity. We employ an evolutionary search for hybrids following the Strength Pareto approach, which isolates hybrids that are not dominated by others (i.e., the so called Pareto frontier). Experimental results on two recommendation scenarios show that: (i) we can combine recommendation algorithms in order to improve an objective without significantly hurting other objectives, and (ii) we allow for adjusting the compromise between accuracy, diversity and novelty, so that the recommendation emphasis can be adjusted dynamically according to the needs of different users.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,orbital hybridisation;recommender system;data mining;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

We computationally explore the properties of our model and apply our framework to estimate the efficiency of different rating scales for real world datasets. We then estimate how the amount of information predictions give to users is related to the scale ratings are collected on. Our findings suggest a tradeoff in rating scale granularity: while previous research indicates that coarse scales (such as thumbs up / thumbs down) take less time, we find that ratings with these scales provide less predictive value to users.

Besides, the results show that the group recommendation strategy which produces the most accurate results is depending on the algorithm that is used for generating individual recommendations.

However, different from the classic active learning, users (the ""oracle"") are not always able to provide an answer for queries. The easiest way to solve this problem is to ask most popular items, i.e items which have received many ratings from training users. But it is static and presents the same items to all users regardless of the ratings they have provided so far.

We also put a special emphasis on soliciting demonstrations, leading to a record number of 10 demos accepted to the conference. In addition, this year continues the tradition of attractive collocated workshops, with a total of 8. Finally, 8 PhD students have been accepted to participate in the Doctoral Symposium. In parallel to growing and diversifying participation opportunities, the selectivity of the short paper track was substantially increased, while the competitive acceptance rate of the long paper track was maintained. Overall, the number of paper submissions went up almost 10% as compared to last year, with a total of 185 submissions.

Web 2.0 users explicitly provide personal information and implicitly express preferences through their interactions with others and the system (e.g. commenting, friending, rating, etc.). These various new sources of knowledge can be leveraged to improve recommendation techniques and develop new strategies which focus on social recommendation. (2) New application areas for recommender systems emerge with the popularity of the Social Web. Recommenders cannot only be used to sort and filter Web 2.0 and social network information, they can also support users in the information sharing process, e.g., by recommending suitable tags during folksonomy development. (3) Recommender technology can assist Social Web systems through increasing adoption and participation and sustaining membership. Through targeted and timely intervention which stimulates traffic and interaction, recommender technology can play its role in sustaining the success of the Social Web. (4) The Social Web also presents new challenges for recommender systems, such as the complicated nature of human-to-human interaction which comes into play when recommending people and can require more interactive and richer recommender systems user interfaces. The technical papers appearing in these proceedings aim to explore and understand challenges and new opportunities for recommender systems in the Social Web and were selected in a formal review process by an international program committee. Overall, we received 13 paper submissions from 12 different countries, out of which 7 long papers and 1 short paper were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. The submitted papers addressed a variety of topics related to Social Web recommender systems from the use of microblogging data for personalization over new tag recommendation approaches to social media-based personalization of news.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,web modeling;social semantic web;social web;web development;personalization;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

Our contributions with this study are 1) A novel recommendation delivery paradigm called Social Referral , which utilizes a user's social network for the delivery of relevant content. 2) An implementation of the paradigm is described in a real industrial production setting of a large online professional network. 3) A study of the interaction between the trifecta of the recommender system, the trusted connections and the end consumer of the recommendation by comparing and contrasting the proposed approach's performance with the direct recommender system. Our experiments indicate that Social Referral is a promising mechanism for recommendation delivery. The experiments show that a significant portion of users are receptive to passing along relevant recommendations to their social networks, and that recommendations delivered through users' social networks are much more likely to be accepted than those directly delivered to users.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,industrial production;social network;recommender system;knowledge management;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

We exploit the implicit feedback derived from the user's listening behavior, and we model channel recommendation as a sequential decision making problem. We have implemented a personal RS that integrates reinforcement learning techniques to decide what channel to play every time the user asks for a new music track or the current track finishes playing.

Therefore, calculations are limited to locally processed algorithms, privacy concerns can be taken into account and algorithms are suitable for decentralized or peer-to-peer architectures. We have implemented and evaluated our approach against five others, using the Epinions trust network. We show that local information with good default scoring strategies are sufficient to cover more users than classical collaborative filtering and trust-based recommender systems.

A solution to this was to generate recommendations probabilistically, which is an approach that has been shown to be robust against some manipulation techniques as well.

This problem of finding similar items for the recommendation task may also be viewed as a link prediction problem in a network, where the items can be treated as the nodes. The strength of the edge connecting two items represents the similarity between the items. In this context, a central challenge is to suitably define an appropriate dissimilarity function between the items. For content based recommender systems, the dissimilarity function should take into account the individual attributes of the items. The same attribute may have different importances in different parts of the underlying network. We focus on the problem of learning a suitable dissimilarity function between items and address it by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem which captures the local weightages of the attributes in different regions of the graph. The constraints are imposed in such a way that the non-connected nodes show higher value of dissimilarity than the connected nodes. The local tuning of the weights learns the optimal value of weights in various parts of the network: from the portions having rich graph information to the portions having only content information.

First, today's web users are more willing to share more about themselves than before the Web 2.0, thus providing more information sources that can be leveraged in the user modeling and recommendation process. Furthermore, the newly available information sources can not only be used to optimize the recommendations for an individual user, but can also help to identify more general patterns and trends in the behavior of the community that can be exploited by other applications. Second, personalization, information filtering and recommendation are often the central functionality of many of these social web based applications. On typical social networks, users for example get recommendations for news to read, songs to listen to, groups to join, friends to follow, people to connect or jobs that might be interesting. These developments lead to different challenges to be addressed in recommender systems research. On the one hand, for example, the question arises of how to effectively combine the huge variety of information sources for improved recommendations. On the other hand, regarding the new opportunities for applying recommender systems in social web environments, in many cases new techniques are required to address the particularities of the domain or to deal with scalability issues. The ACM RecSys 2014 Workshop on Recommender Systems and the Social Web aims to be a platform for researchers from academia and industry as well as for practitioners to present and discuss the various challenges and possible solutions related to all aspects of social web recommendations. The call for papers correspondingly covered a variety of topics in this area including all sorts of applications of recommender systems technology and their interfaces; collective knowledge creation and topic emergence;context-aware and group recommendation approaches; and case studies and empirical evaluations. This year's workshop was already the sixth in a series of successful workshops co-located with the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems since 2009. Again, we received several submissions from researchers from academia and industry which were thoroughly reviewed and selected for presentation at the workshop by a program committee of international experts in the field. The papers submitted to the workshop addressed a number of different topics and put forward novel proposals to build social web recommender system. In the context of applying recommendation technology to information personalization and resource ranking problems in Social Web environments, the submitted papers for example dealt with the problem of ranking community-provided product reviews based on opinion mining or with the recommendation of friends on social networks. As an example of how to leverage Social Web information to build better systems, one of the works proposed to analyze the characteristics of publicly shared music playlists to better understand how future music recommendation systems should be designed. Finally, another contribution from industry addressed challenges and lessons learned when building large-scale collaborative filtering solutions on Social Web platforms in a real-world environment.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,web modeling;social semantic web;social web;web development;personalization;web engineering;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

In this paper, I survey visual approaches that go beyond presenting the recommended items as a textual list or as annotations in context. I also review related literature from recommendations' explanations.

High quality recommendations for small communities: the case of a regional parent network,Sven Strickroth (Clausthal University of Technology);Niels Pinkwart (Clausthal University of Technology);,"2436547803,133666533","Traditional recommender systems are well established in scenarios in which ""enough""items, users and ratings are available for the algorithms to operate on. However, automatic recommendations are also desirable in smaller online communities which only contain several hundred items and users. Collaborative filters, as one of the most successful technologies for recommender systems, do not perform well here. This paper argues that recommender systems can make use of contextual information and domain specific semantics in order to be able to generate recommendations also for these smaller usage scenarios. The new hybrid recommendation approach presented in the paper enhances traditional neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques through the use of new kinds of data and a combination of different recommendation methods (rule, demographic, and average based). While the algorithmic techniques presented in this paper are suitable (especially) for smaller online communities, they can also be applied to improve the quality of recommendations in larger communities. The approach was implemented and evaluated in a small regional bound parent education community. A multi-staged evaluation was conducted in order to determine the quality of recommendations: A cross-validation (recall), an expert questionnaire (recommendation quality) and a field study (user satisfaction). The results show that recommenders even for smaller communities are possible and can produce high quality recommendations.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;sparsity of effects principle;cross validation;recommender system;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Recommendation challenges in web media settings,Ronny Lempel (Yahoo!);,2249016471,"This paper calls out several research challenges in the art of recommendation technology as applied in Web media sites. One particular characteristic of such recommendation settings is the relative low cost of falsely recommending an irrelevant item, which means that recommendation schemes can be less conservative and more exploratory.

Other technical difficulties include analyzing offline data that is heavily biased by the site's appearance, and in a related vein -- once a recommendation module's appearance has been designed -- defining the correct metrics by which to measure it.

Remembering the stars?: effect of time on preference retrieval from memory,Dgfm Dirk Bollen (Eindhoven University of Technology);Mp Mark Graus (Eindhoven University of Technology);Mc Martijn Willemsen (Eindhoven University of Technology);,"2305061428,2149457324,2127679984","Many recommendation systems rely on explicit ratings provided by their users. Often these ratings are provided long after consuming the item, relying heavily on people's representation of the quality of the item in memory. This paper investigates a psychological process, the ""positivity effect"", that influences the retrieval of quality judgments from our memory by which pleasant items are being processed and recalled from memory more effectively than unpleasant items. In an offline study on the MovieLens data we used the time between release date and rating date as a proxy for the time between consumption and rating. Ratings for movies tend to increase over time, consistent with the positivity effect. A subsequent online user study used a direct measure of time between rating and consumption, by asking users to rate movies (recently aired on television) and to explicitly report how long ago they watched these movies. In contrast to the offline study we find that ratings tend to decline over time showing reduced accuracy in ratings for items experienced long ago. We discuss the impact these rating dynamics might have on recommender algorithms, especially in cases where a new user has to submit his preferences to a system.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,time consistency;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

Few approaches for recommending tags to a user for a document address this new item problem, concentrating instead on artificially created post-core datasets where it is guaranteed that the user as well as the document of each test post is known to the system and already has some tags assigned to it. In order to recommend tags for new documents, approaches are required which model documents not only based on the tags assigned to them in the past (if any), but also the content. In this paper we present a novel adaptation to the widely recognised FolkRank tag recommendation algorithm by including content data. We adapt the FolkRank graph to use word nodes instead of document nodes, enabling it to recommend tags for new documents based on their textual content. Our adaptations make FolkRank applicable to post-core 1 ie. the full real-world tagging datasets and address the new item problem in tag recommendation. For comparison, we also apply and evaluate the same methodology of including content on a simpler tag recommendation algorithm. This results in a less expensive recommender which suggests a combination of user related and document content related tags. Including content data into FolkRank shows an improvement over plain FolkRank on full tagging datasets. However, we also observe that our simpler content-aware tag recommender outperforms FolkRank with content data.

Along with text Web pages, images have been becoming important media to place relevant advertisements. Visual contextual advertising, a young research area, refers to finding relevant text advertisements for a target image without any textual information (e.g., tags). There are two existing approaches, advertisement search based on image annotation, and more recently, advertisement matching based on feature translation between images and texts. However, the state of the art fails to achieve satisfactory results due to the fact that recommended advertisements are syntactically matched but semantically mismatched. In this paper, we propose a semantic approach to improving the performance of visual contextual advertising. More specifically, we exploit a large high-quality image knowledge base (ImageNet) and a widely-used text knowledge base (Wikipedia) to build a bridge between target images and advertisements. The image-advertisement match is built by mapping images and advertisements into the respective knowledge bases and then finding semantic matches between the two knowledge bases. The experimental results show that semantic match outperforms syntactic match significantly using test images from Flickr. We also show that our approach gives a large improvement of 16.4% on the precision of the top 10 matches over previous work, with more semantically relevant advertisements recommended.",2012,Conference on Recommender Systems,web page;knowledge base;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;computer science;

"Distributed, real-time bayesian learning in online services",Ralf Herbrich (Facebook);,2693067968,"The last ten years have seen a tremendous growth in Internet-based online services such as search, advertising, gaming and social networking. Today, it is important to analyze large collections of user interaction data as a first step in building predictive models for these services as well as learn these models in real-time. One of the biggest challenges in this setting is scale: not only does the sheer scale of data necessitate parallel processing but it also necessitates distributed models; with over 900 million active users at Facebook, any user-specific sets of features in a linear or non-linear model yields models of a size bigger than can be stored in a single system. In this talk, I will give a hands-on introduction to one of the most versatile tools for handling large collections of data with distributed probabilistic models: the sum-product algorithm for approximate message passing in factor graphs.

Useful recommendation of experts, however, is not an easy task for many reasons: It requires reasoning about multiple complex networks from heterogeneous sources (such as collaboration networks of individuals, article citation networks, and concept networks) and depends significantly on the needs of individuals in seeking recommendations. Although over the past decade much effort has gone into developing techniques to increase and evaluate the quality of recommendations, personalizing recommendations according to individuals' motivations has not received much attention. While previous work in the literature has focused primarily on identifying experts, our focus here is on personalizing the selection of an expert through a principled application of social science theories to model the user's motivation. In this paper, we present an expert recommender system capable of applying multiple theoretical mechanisms to the problem of personalized recommendations through profiling users' motivations and their relations. To this end, we use the Multi-Theoretical Multi-Level (MTML) framework which investigates social drivers for network formation in the communities with diverse goals. This framework serves as the theoretical basis for mapping motivations to the appropriate domain data, heuristic, and objective functions for the personalized expert recommendation. As a proof of concept, we developed a prototype recommender grounded in social science theories, and utilizing computational techniques from social network analysis and representational techniques from the semantic web to facilitate combining and operating on data from heterogeneous sources. We evaluated the prototype's ability to predict collaborations for scientific research teams, using a simple off-line methodology. Preliminary results demonstrate encouraging success while offering significant personalization options and providing flexibility in customizing the recommendation heuristic based on users' motivations. In particular, recommendation heuristics based on different motivation profiles result in different recommendations, and taken as a whole better capture the diversity of observed expert collaboration.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,semantic web;social network analysis;external data representation;knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

We propose an approach for weighting each interaction, such that we can determine the importance of each interaction to the preference prediction task. We model the preferences using kernel matrix factorization; where the kernels capture the weighted effects of the interactions.

Different evaluation metrics have been reported in the literature but the precise relation, distinction or equivalence between them has not been explicitly studied. Furthermore, the metrics reported so far miss important properties such as taking into consideration the ranking of recommended items, or whether items are relevant or not, when assessing the novelty and diversity of recommendations. We present a formal framework for the definition of novelty and diversity metrics that unifies and generalizes several state of the art metrics.

Published research uses various experimental methodologies and metrics that are difficult to compare. It also often fails to sufficiently document the details of proposed algorithms or the evaluations employed. Researchers waste time reimplementing well-known algorithms, and the new implementations may miss key details from the original algorithm or its subsequent refinements. When proposing new algorithms, researchers should compare them against finely-tuned implementations of the leading prior algorithms using state-of-the-art evaluation methodologies. With few exceptions, published algorithmic improvements in our field should be accompanied by working code in a standard framework, including test harnesses to reproduce the described results. To that end, we present the design and freely distributable source code of LensKit, a flexible platform for reproducible recommender systems research. LensKit provides carefully tuned implementations of the leading collaborative filtering algorithms, APIs for common recommender system use cases, and an evaluation framework for performing reproducible offline evaluations of algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of LensKit by replicating and extending a set of prior comparative studies of recommender algorithms --- showing limitations in some of the original results --- and by investigating a question recently raised by a leader in the recommender systems community on problems with error-based prediction evaluation.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,distributed source coding;collaborative filtering;use case;implementation;evaluation;comparative research;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

OrdRec: an ordinal model for predicting personalized item rating distributions,Yehuda Koren (Yahoo!);Joe Sill;,"1966367906,2126573082","We propose a collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation framework, which is based on viewing user feedback on products as ordinal, rather than the more common numerical view. This way, we do not need to interpret each user feedback value as a number, but only rely on the more relaxed assumption of having an order among the different feedback ratings. Such an ordinal view frequently provides a more natural reflection of the user intention when providing qualitative ratings, allowing users to have different internal scoring scales. Moreover, we can address scenarios where assigning numerical scores to different types of user feedback would not be easy. Our approach is based on a pointwise ordinal model, which allows it to linearly scale with data size. The framework can wrap most collaborative filtering algorithms, upgrading those algorithms designed to handle numerical values into being able to handle ordinal values. In particular, we demonstrate our framework with wrapping a leading matrix factorization CF method. A cornerstone of our method is its ability to predict a full probability distribution of the expected item ratings, rather than only a single score for an item. One of the advantages this brings is a novel approach to estimating the confidence level in each individual prediction. Compared to previous approaches to confidence estimation, ours is more principled and empirically superior in its accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on some of the largest publicly available datasets, the Netflix data, and the Yahoo! Music data.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;matrix decomposition;confidence interval;algorithm design;probability distribution;recommender system;data science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Item popularity and recommendation accuracy,Harald Steck (Alcatel-Lucent);,2618988043,"Recommendations from the long tail of the popularity distribution of items are generally considered to be particularly valuable. On the other hand, recommendation accuracy tends to decrease towards the long tail. In this paper, we quantitatively examine this trade-off between item popularity and recommendation accuracy. To this end, we assume that there is a selection bias towards popular items in the available data. This allows us to define a new accuracy measure that can be gradually tuned towards the long tail. We show that, under this assumption, this measure has the desirable property of providing nearly unbiased estimates concerning recommendation accuracy. In turn, this also motivates a refinement for training collaborative-filtering approaches. In various experiments with real-world data, including a user study, empirical evidence suggests that only a small, if any, bias of the recommendations towards less popular items is appreciated by users.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,long tail;collaborative filtering;selection bias;bias of an estimator;empirical evidence;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Enhancing collaborative filtering systems with personality information,Rong Hu (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);Pearl Pu (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);,"2724045533,2148520950","Collaborative filtering (CF), one of the most successful recommendation approaches, continues to attract interest in both academia and industry. However, one key issue limiting the success of collaborative filtering in certain application domains is the cold-start problem, a situation where historical data is too sparse (known as the sparsity problem), new users have not rated enough items (known as the new user problem), or both. In this paper, we aim at addressing the cold-start problem by incorporating human personality into the collaborative filtering framework. We propose three approaches: the first is a recommendation method based on users' personality information alone; the second is based on a linear combination of both personality and rating information; and the third uses a cascade mechanism to leverage both resources. To evaluate their effectiveness, we have conducted an experimental study comparing the proposed approaches with the traditional rating-based CF in two cold-start scenarios: sparse data sets and new users. Our results show that the proposed CF variations, which consider personality characteristics, can significantly improve the performance of the traditional rating-based CF in terms of the evaluation metrics MAE and ROC sensitivity.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,cold start;collaborative filtering;sparse matrix;personality;recommender system;data science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

This paper compares four different rating scales: unary (""like it""), binary (thumbs up / thumbs down), five-star, and a 100-point slider. Our analysis draws upon 12,847 movie and product review ratings collected from 348 users through an online survey. We a) measure the time and cognitive load required by each scale, b) study how rating time varies with the rating value assigned by a user, and c) survey users' satisfaction with each scale. Overall, users work harder with more granular rating scales, but these effects are moderated by item domain (product reviews or movies). Given a particular scale, users rating times vary significantly for items they like and dislike. Our findings about users' rating effort and satisfaction suggest guidelines for designers choosing between rating scales.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,rating scale;recommender system;world wide web;computer science;

In this paper, we have particularly explored a new kind of social relation, the membership, and its combined effect with friendship. The two type of heterogeneous social relations are fused into the CF recommender via a factorization process. Due to the two relations' respective properties, we adopt different fusion strategies: regularization was leveraged for friendship and collective matrix factorization (CMF) was proposed for incorporating membership. We further developed a unified model to combine the two relations together and tested it with real large-scale datasets at five sparsity levels.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to multi-criteria recommendation, based on the idea of clustering users in ""preference lattices"" (partial orders) according to their criteria preferences. We assume that some selection criteria for an item (product or a service) will dominate the overall ranking, and that these dominant criteria will be different for different users. Following this assumption, we cluster users based on their criteria preferences, creating a ""preference lattice"". The recommendation output for a user is then based on ratings by other users from the same or close clusters. Having introduced the general approach of clustering, we proceed to formulate three alternative recommendation methods instantiating the approach: (a) using the aggregation function of the criteria, (b) using the overall item ratings, and (c) combining clustering with collaborative filtering. We then evaluate the accuracy of the three methods using a set of experiments on a service ranking dataset, and compare them with a conventional collaborative filtering approach extended to cover multiple criteria. The results indicate that our third method, which combines clustering and extended collaborative filtering, produces the highest accuracy.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;service;partially ordered set;cluster analysis;recommender system;knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Not only do we show that the selected representatives are superior to other competing methods in terms of achieving good balance between coverage and diversity, but we also demonstrate that ratings on the selected representatives are much more useful for making recommendations (about 10% better than competing methods).

Matrix factorization methods that computes a low-rank approximation of the incomplete user-item rating matrix provide state-of-the-art performance, especially for users and items with several past ratings (warm starts). However, it is a challenge to generalize such methods to users and items with few or no past ratings (cold starts). Prior work [4][32] have generalized matrix factorization to include both user and item features for performing better regularization of factors as well as provide a model for smooth transition from cold starts to warm starts. However, the features were incorporated via linear regression on factor estimates. In this paper, we generalize this process to allow for arbitrary regression models like decision trees, boosting, LASSO, etc. The key advantage of our approach is the ease of computing --- any new regression procedure can be incorporated by ""plugging"" in a standard regression routine into a few intermediate steps of our model fitting procedure. With this flexibility, one can leverage a large body of work on regression modeling, variable selection, and model interpretation.

However, CF may not fully reflect the procedure how people choose an item in real life, for users are more likely to ask friends for opinions instead of asking similar strangers. Recently, some recommendation methods based on social network have been raised. These approaches incorporate social network into the CF algorithms and users' preferences can be influenced by the favors of their friends. These social approaches require the knowledge of similarities among friends. There are two popular similarity functions: Vector Space Similarity (VSS) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). However, both friends similarity functions are based on the item-sets they rated in common. In most cases, these functions are impractical, i.e. if two friends do not share the same items in common, the similarity between them will be zeros. To solve this problem, we propose an Adaptive Social Similarity (ASS) function based on the matrix factorization technique.

For systems in which users generate streams of content ( e.g., blogs, periodically-updated newsfeeds), users may rate the produced content that they read, and be given accurate predictions about future content they are most likely to prefer. We design a distributed mechanism for predicting user ratings that avoids the disclosure of information to a centralized authority or an untrusted third party: users disclose the rating they give to certain content only to the user that produced this content. We demonstrate how rating prediction in this context can be formulated as a matrix factorization problem. Using this intuition, we propose a distributed gradient descent algorithm for its solution that abides with the above restriction on how information is exchanged between users. We formally analyse the convergence properties of this algorithm, showing that it reduces a weighted root mean square error of the accuracy of predictions. Although our algorithm may be used many different ways, we evaluate it on the Neflix data set and prediction problem as a benchmark. In addition to the improved privacy properties that stem from its distributed nature, our algorithm is competitive with current centralized solutions.

We have designed an approach for this novel recommendation task by matching music to POIs using emotional tags. In order to test our approach, we have developed a mobile application that suggests an itinerary and plays recommended music for each visited POI.

Multi-value probabilistic matrix factorization for IP-TV recommendations,Yu Xin (Massachusetts Institute of Technology);Harald Steck (Alcatel-Lucent);,"2704476561,2618988043","Matrix factorization (MF) has evolved as one of the most accurate approaches to collaborative filtering. In this paper, we extend the probabilistic MF framework as to account for multiple observations for each matrix element. This significantly improves the accuracy of recommender systems in several areas: (1) aggregation of ratings concerning items organized hierarchically, (2) (partial) compensation for the selection bias in the observed data by using an appropriate prior with virtual data points, and (3) improved recommendations of TV shows. While our framework applies to explicit and implicit feedback data, we outline in detail the latter application in this paper: we present the first approach that takes into account also negative feedback when training on implicit feedback data. Moreover, we shed light on the implicit assumptions underlying the most successful approach to IP-TV (Internet Protocol Television) recommendations in [Hu et al. 2008].

These similarities can be used in the recommendation process and improve ranking predictions. We find that this method is most effective in cases where ratings are extremely sparse or nonexistent.

A generalized stochastic block model for recommendation in social rating networks,Mohsen Jamali (Simon Fraser University);Tianle Huang (Simon Fraser University);Martin Ester (Simon Fraser University);,"2617375404,2222379032,2067196623","The rapidly increasing availability of online social networks and the well-known effect of social influence have motivated research on social-network based recommenders. Social influence and selection together lead to the formation of communities of like-minded and well connected users. Exploiting the clustering of users and items is one of the most important approaches for model-based recommendation. Users may belong to multiple communities or groups, but only a few clustering algorithms allow clusters to overlap. One of these algorithms is the probabilistic EM clustering method, which assumes that data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian models. The mixed membership stochastic block model (MMB) transfers the idea of EM clustering from conventional, non-relational data to social network data. In this paper, we introduce a generalized stochastic blockmodel (GSBM) that models not only the social relations but also the rating behavior. This model learns the mixed group membership assignments for both users and items in an SRN. GSBM can predict the future behavior of users, both the rating of items and creation of links to other users. We performed experiments on two real life datasets from Epinions.com and Flixster.com, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed GSBM for rating prediction as well as link prediction.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,fuzzy clustering;social influence;mixture model;relational database;social network;cluster analysis;social relation;data science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Investigating crime can be a challenging and difficult task, especially in cases with many potential suspects and inconsistent witness accounts or inconsistencies between witness accounts and physical evidence. We present here a novel approach to crime suspect recommendation based on partial knowledge of offenders involved in a crime incident and a known co-offending network. To solve this problem, we propose a random walk based method for recommending the top- K potential suspects. By evaluating the proposed method on a large crime dataset for the Province of British Columbia, Canada, we show experimentally that this method outperforms baseline random walk and association rule-based methods. Additionally, results obtained for public domain data from experiments for co-author recommendation on a DBLP co-authorship network are consistent with those on the crime dataset. Compared to the crime dataset, the performance of all competitors is much better on the DBLP dataset, confirming that crime suspect recommendation is an inherently harder task.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,public domain;association rule learning;random walk;world wide web;computer security;computer science;

A market-based approach to address the new item problem,Sarabjot Singh Anand (University of Warwick);Nathan Griffiths (University of Warwick);,"2278760076,2142126282","In this paper we propose a market-based approach for seeding recommendations for new items in which publishers bid to have items presented to the most influential users for each item. Users are able to select (or not) items for rating on an earn-per-rating basis, with payment given for providing a rating regardless of whether the rating is positive or negative. This approach reduces the time taken to obtain ratings for new items, while encouraging users to give honest ratings (to increase their influence) which in turn supports the quality of recommendations. To support this approach we propose techniques for inferring the social influence network from users' rating vectors and recommendation lists. Using this influence network we apply existing heuristics for estimating a user's influence, adapting them to account for the new items already presented to a user. We also propose an extension to Chen et al.'s Degree Discount heuristic [Chen et al. 2009], to enable it to be used in this context.

In this paper, we use collaborative filtering (CF) to generate recommendations for all users, and by using stochastic matching we select a number of reciprocal recommendations for each user that maximizes the matches among all users. In this way, all users, regardless of their popularity, will receive the same number of recommendations the number of times they will be recommended to others. This study is the first to apply a stochastic matching solution to balance the number of recommendations given to users in a CF setting.

My head is your tail: applying link analysis on long-tailed music listening behavior for music recommendation,Kibeom Lee (Seoul National University);Kyogu Lee (Seoul National University);,"2288342244,2099145312","Collaborative filtering, being a popular method for generating recommendations, produces satisfying results for users by providing extremely relevant items. Despite being popular, however, this method is prone to many problems. One of these problems is popularity bias, in which the system becomes skewed towards items that are popular amongst the general user population. These 'obvious' items are, technically, extremely relevant items but fail to be novel. In this paper, we maintain using collaborative filtering methods while still managing to produce novel yet relevant items. This is achieved by utilizing the long-tailed distribution of listening behavior of users, in which their playlists are biased towards a few songs while the rest of the songs, those in the long tail, have relatively low play counts. In addition, we also apply a link analysis method to users and define links between them to create an increasingly fine-grained approach in calculating weights for the recommended items. The proposed recommendation method was available online as a user study in order to measure the relevancy and novelty of the recommended items. Results show that the algorithm manages to include novel recommendations that are still relevant, and shows the potential for a new way of generating novel recommendations.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,link analysis;long tail;collaborative filtering;satisfiability;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

Robustness of recommender systems,Neil J.

One scenario proposed was that an author, motivated to increase recommendations of his book, might create a set of false profiles that rate the book highly, in an effort to artificially promote the ratings given by the system to genuine users. Several attack models have been proposed and the performance of these attacks in terms of influencing the system predictions has been evaluated for a number of memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering algorithms. Moreover, strategies have been proposed to enhance the robustness of existing algorithms and new algorithms have been proposed with built-in attack resistance.

Results provide strong evidence that the rating provided by a recommender system serves as an anchor for the consumer's constructed preference. Consumer's preferences appear malleable and can be significantly influenced by the recommendation received. Additionally, the effects of pure number-based anchoring can be separated from the effects of the perceived reliability of a recommender system. In particular, when the recommender system was described to the participants as being in testing phase, the anchoring effect was reduced. Finally, the effect of anchoring is roughly continuous, operating over a range of perturbations of the system.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,recommender system;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

However, there can be several different algorithms that are used to generate news recommendations, and the strategies for manipulation resistance are likely specific to the algorithm (or class of algorithm) employed. In this paper we will focus on a common method used by many media sites of recommending the N most read (or popular) articles (e.g. New York Times, BBC, Wall Street Journal all prominently use this). Through simulation results we show that whereas recommendation of the N most read articles is easily susceptible to manipulation, a simple probabilistic variant is more robust to common manipulation strategies. Further, for the "" N most read"" recommender, probabilistic selection has other desirable properties. Specifically, the ( N +1) th article, which may have ""just"" missed making the cutoff, is unduly penalized under common user models. Small differences initially are easily amplified -- an observation that can be used by manipulators. Probabilistic selection, on the other hand, creates no such artificial penalty.

To this end, in this paper, we introduce a collective training paradigm to automatically and effectively augment the training ratings. Essentially, the collective training paradigm builds multiple different Collaborative Filtering (CF) models separately, and augments the training ratings of each CF model by using the partial predictions of other CF models for unknown ratings. Along this line, we develop two algorithms, Bi-CF and Tri-CF, based on collective training . For Bi-CF and Tri-CF, we collectively and iteratively train two and three different CF models via iteratively augmenting training ratings for individual CF model. We also design different criteria to guide the selection of augmented training ratings for Bi-CF and Tri-CF.

Recommendations as a conversation with the user,Daniel Tunkelang (LinkedIn);,2344117179,"Recommender systems provide users with products or content intended to satisfy their information needs. The primary evaluation measures for recommender systems emphasize either the perceived relevance of the recommendations or the actions driven by those recommendations (e.g., purchases on ecommerce sites or clicks on news and social networking sites). Unfortunately, this transactional emphasis neglects the inherently interactive nature of the user experience. This tutorial explores recommendations as part of a conversation between users and systems. A conversational approach should provide transparency, control, and guidance. Transparency means that users understand why systems offer particular recommendations. Control means that users can explicitly manipulate the behavior of recommender systems based on personal needs and preferences. Guidance means that systems offers plausible and predictable next steps rather than requiring users to guess the consequences of their interactions. Finally, there are psychological factors -- in particular, the faith that users place in the recommender system's effectiveness. Since users develop mental models of recommender systems, the system should become more predictable with repeated use. The tutorial does not require any special background in interfaces or usability.

Social link recommendation by learning hidden topics,Masoud Makrehchi (Thomson Reuters);,2128815193,"In this paper, a new approach to predicting the structure of a social network without any prior knowledge from the social links is proposed. In absence of links among nodes, we assume there are other information resources associated with the nodes which are called node profiles. The task of link prediction and recommendation from text data is to learn similarities between the nodes and then translate pair-wise similarities into social links. In other words, the process is to convert a similarity matrix into an adjacency matrix. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed. First, hidden topics of node profiles are learned using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Then, by mapping node-topic and topic-topic relations, a new structure called semi-bipartite graph is generated which is slightly different from regular bipartite graph. Finally, by applying topological metrics such as Katz and short path scores to the new structure, we are able to rank and recommend relevant links to each node. The proposed technique is applied to several co-authorship networks. While most link prediction methods are low precision solutions, the proposed method performs effectively and offers high precision.",2011,Conference on Recommender Systems,adjacency matrix;bipartite graph;latent dirichlet allocation;social network;world wide web;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;

Item neighborhood list is chosen as the shared data from the contributor party with considering differential privacy. And an innovative algorithm called neighborhood boosting is proposed to make the beneficiary party leverage the shared data. MovieLens and Netflix data sets are considered as two parties to simulate and evaluate the proposed shared CF approach. The experiment results validate the positive effects of shared CF for increasing the recommendation accuracy of the beneficiary party. Especially when the beneficiary party's data is quite sparse, the performance can be increased by around 10%. The experiments also show that shared CF even outperforms the methods that incorporate the detailed original rating scores of the contributor party without considering the privacy issues.

Design guidelines for mobile group recommender systems to handle inaccurate or missing location data,Markus Tschersich (Goethe University Frankfurt);,1908539170,"Today's group recommender systems do not consider unavailable, inaccessible, or incomplete user information of one ore more members within a group. This is a problem for mobile group recommender system, because changed user behaviour or technical limitations of mobile services let user may not be willing or able to disclose all information, which are part of a user profile in a mobile environment. For location information, as one of the most important type of user information for an ad-hoc mobile recommendation service, this can lead to inaccurate, or missing location information. Inaccurate or missing location information has an impact on different parts of building group recommendations. This impact reduces the quality of recommendations, which is a key-challenge of recommender systems. Therefore, design guidelines are needed to address the problem of missing or inaccurate location information in mobile group recommender systems.

A probabilistic definition of item similarity,Oliver Jojic;Manu Shukla;Niranjan Bhosarekar;,"2701533635,2684362625,2229382316","In item-based collaborative filtering, a critical intermediate step to personalized recommendations is the definition of an item-similarity metric. Existing algorithms compute the item-similarity using the user-to-item ratings (cosine, Pearson, Jaccard, etc.). When computing the similarity between two items A and B many of these algorithms divide the actual number of co-occurring users by some ""difficulty"" of co-occurrence. We refine this approach by defining item similarity as the ratio of the actual number of co-occurrences to the number of co-occurrences that would be expected if user choices were random. In the final step of our method to compute personalized recommendations we apply the usage history of a user to the item similarity matrix. The well defined probabilistic meaning of our similarities allows us to further improve this final step. We measured the quality of our algorithm on a large real-world data-set. As part of Comcast's efforts to improve its personalized recommendations of movies and TV shows, several top recommender companies were invited to apply their algorithms to one year of Video-on-Demand usage data.

Both approaches can be implemented by extending either the well known neighborhood model or the matrix factorization. For the social network track, we developed and compared two extensions of the matrix factorization models for incorporating the social network structure, namely collective matrix factorization(CMF) and network regularized matrix factorization(NRMF).

Performance of recommender algorithms on top-n recommendation tasks,Paolo Cremonesi (Instituto Politécnico Nacional);Yehuda Koren (Yahoo!);Roberto Turrin (Instituto Politécnico Nacional);,"1246103178,1966367906,2032104361","In many commercial systems, the 'best bet' recommendations are shown, but the predicted rating values are not. This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall). An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recommender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accuracy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non-personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, regardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other recommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommendation task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,recall;collaborative filtering;accuracy and precision;evaluation;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
A matrix factorization technique with trust propagation for recommendation in social networks,Mohsen Jamali (Simon Fraser University);Martin Ester (Simon Fraser University);,"2617375404,2067196623","Recommender systems are becoming tools of choice to select the online information relevant to a given user. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users that have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets, the public domain Epinions.com dataset and a much larger dataset that we have recently crawled from Flixster.com.

However, most model-based Collaborative Filtering approaches such as Matrix Factorization do not provide a straightforward way of integrating context information into the model. In this work, we introduce a Collaborative Filtering method based on Tensor Factorization , a generalization of Matrix Factorization that allows for a flexible and generic integration of contextual information by modeling the data as a User-Item-Context N -dimensional tensor instead of the traditional 2D User-Item matrix. In the proposed model, called Multiverse Recommendation , different types of context are considered as additional dimensions in the representation of the data as a tensor. The factorization of this tensor leads to a compact model of the data which can be used to provide context-aware recommendations. We provide an algorithm to address the N -dimensional factorization, and show that the Multiverse Recommendation improves upon non-contextual Matrix Factorization up to 30% in terms of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We also compare to two state-of-the-art context-aware methods and show that Tensor Factorization consistently outperforms them both in semi-synthetic and real-world data - improvements range from 2.5% to more than 12% depending on the data.

Sample applications include travel planning with a limited budget (price or time) and twitter users wanting to select worthwhile tweeters to follow given that they can deal with only a bounded number of tweets. In these contexts, there is a need for a system that can recommend top- k packages for the user to choose from. Motivated by these applications, we consider composite recommendations , where each recommendation comprises a set of items. Each item has both a value (rating) and a cost associated with it, and the user specifies a maximum total cost (budget) for any recommended set of items. Our composite recommender system has access to one or more component recommender system, focusing on different domains, as well as to information sources which can provide the cost associated with each item. Because the problem of generating the top recommendation (package) is NP-complete, we devise several approximation algorithms for generating top- k packages as recommendations. We analyze their efficiency as well as approximation quality. Finally, using two real and two synthetic data sets, we subject our algorithms to thorough experimentation and empirical analysis. Our findings attest to the efficiency and quality of our approximation algorithms for top- k packages compared to exact algorithms.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,synthetic data;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;database;machine learning;computer science;
Fast als-based matrix factorization for explicit and implicit feedback datasets,István Pilászy (Budapest University of Technology and Economics);Dávid Zibriczky (Budapest University of Technology and Economics);Domonkos Tikk (Humboldt University of Berlin);,"231266601,2307229522,165729861","Alternating least squares (ALS) is a powerful matrix factorization (MF) algorithm for both explicit and implicit feedback based recommender systems. As shown in many articles, increasing the number of latent factors (denoted by K ) boosts the prediction accuracy of MF based recommender systems, including ALS as well. The price of the better accuracy is paid by the increased running time: the running time of the original version of ALS is proportional to K 3 . Yet, the running time of model building can be important in recommendation systems; if the model cannot keep up with the changing item portfolio and/or user profile, the prediction accuracy can be degraded. In this paper we present novel and fast ALS variants both for the implicit and explicit feedback datasets, which offers better trade-off between running time and accuracy. Due to the significantly lower computational complexity of the algorithm - linear in terms of K - the model being generated under the same amount of time is more accurate, since the faster training enables to build model with more latent factors. We demonstrate the efficiency of our ALS variants on two datasets using two performance measures, RMSE and average relative position (ARP), and show that either a significantly more accurate model can be generated under the same amount of time or a model with similar prediction accuracy can be created faster; for explicit feedback the speed-up factor can be even 5-10.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;tikhonov regularization;model building;matrix decomposition;computational complexity theory;recommender system;theoretical computer science;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

The results show that larger sets containing only good items do not necessarily result in higher choice satisfaction compared to smaller sets, as the increased recommendation set attractiveness is counteracted by the increased difficulty of choosing from these sets.

Enhanced vector space models for content-based recommender systems,Cataldo Musto (University of Bari);,2136910177,"The use of Vector Space Models (VSM) in the area of Information Retrieval is an established practice within the scientific community. The reason is twofold: first, its very clean and solid formalism allows us to represent objects in a vector space and to perform calculations on them. On the other hand, as proved by many contributions, its simplicity does not hurt the effectiveness of the model. Although Information Retrieval and Information Filtering undoubtedly represent two related research areas, the use of VSM in Information Filtering is much less analzyed. The goal of this work is to investigate the impact of vector space models in the Information Filtering area. Specifically, I will introduce two approaches: the first one, based on a technique called Random Indexing, reduces the impact of two classical VSM problems, this is to say its high dimensionality and the inability to manage the semantics of documents.

Therefore, the underlying recommendation algorithm should be able to adapt to such changes accordingly. However, most existing algorithms do not distinguish current and historical data when predicting the users' current interests. In this paper, we consider a new problem - online evolutionary collaborative filtering , which tracks user interests over time in order to make timely recommendations.

Optimizing multiple objectives in collaborative filtering,Tamas Jambor (University College London);Jun Wang (University College London);,"1993152032,2557836567","This paper is about the utility of making personalized recommendations. While it is important to accurately predict the target user's preference, in practice the accuracy should not be the only concern ; a useful recommender system needs to consider the user's utility or satisfaction of fulfilling a certain information seeking task. For example, recommending popular items (products) is unlikely to result in more gain than discovering insignificant (""long tail"") yet liked items because the popular ones might be already known to the user. Equally, recommending items that are out of stock would be frustrating for both the user and system if the system is employed to discover items to purchase. Thus, it is important to have a flexible recommendation framework that takes into account additional recommendation goals meanwhile minimizing the performance loss in order to provide greater adjustability and a better user experience. To achieve this, in this paper, we propose a general recommendation optimization framework that not only considers the predicted preference scores (e.g. ratings) but also deals with additional operational or resource related recommendation goals. Using this framework we demonstrate through realistic examples how to expand existing rating prediction algorithms by biasing the recommendation depending on other external factors such as the availability, profitability or usefulness of an item. Our experiments on real data sets demonstrate that this framework is indeed able to cope with multiple objectives with minor performance loss.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,stock management;personalization;long tail;collaborative filtering;profitability index;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

In many social networks, besides friendship links amongst users, the phenomenon of users associating themselves with groups or communities is common. Thus, two networks exist simultaneously: the friendship network among users, and the affiliation network between users and groups. In this paper, we tackle the affiliation recommendation problem, where the task is to predict or suggest new affiliations between users and communities, given the current state of the friendship and affiliation networks. More generally, affiliations need not be community affiliations - they can be a user's taste, so affiliation recommendation algorithms have applications beyond community recommendation. In this paper, we show that information from the friendship network can indeed be fruitfully exploited in making affiliation recommendations. Using a simple way of combining these networks, we suggest two models of user-community affinity for the purpose of making affiliation recommendations: one based on graph proximity, and another using latent factors to model users and communities. We explore the two classes of affiliation recommendation algorithms suggested by these models. We evaluate these algorithms on two real world networks - Orkut and Youtube. In doing so, we motivate and propose a way of evaluating recommenders, by measuring how good the top 50 recommendations are for the average user, and demonstrate the importance of choosing the right evaluation strategy. The algorithms suggested by the graph proximity model turn out to be the most effective and efficient.

Our current research aims at examining the impact of recommenders by understanding how recommendation tools integrate the classical economic schemes and how they modify product search patterns. We report our work in employing an eye tracking system and collecting users' interaction behaviors as they browsed and selected products to buy from an online product retail website offering over 3,500 items. This in-depth user study has enabled us to collect over 48,000 fixation data points and 7,720 areas of interest from eighteen users, each spending more than one hour on our site. Our study shows that while users still use traditional product search tools to examine alternatives, recommenders definitely provide users with new opportunities in their decision process. More specifically, users actively click and gaze at products recommended to them, up to 40% of the time. In addition, recommendation areas are highly attractive, drawing users to add 50% more items to their baskets as a traditional tool does. Observing that users consult the recommendation area more as they are close to the end of their search process, it seems that recommenders enhance users' decision confidence by satisfying their need for diversity. Based on these results, we derive several interaction design guidelines that can significantly improve users' satisfaction and perception of product recommenders.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,interaction design;eye tracking;attention;decision theory;satisfiability;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

This paper proposes a new evaluation method for the dynamic aspects of collaborative algorithms, the ""temporal leave-one-out"" approach, which can provide insight into both user-specific and system-level evolution of recommendation behavior.

Collaborative filtering is a popular approach in which recommending is based on the rating history of the system. One of the most accurate and scalable collaborative filtering algorithms is matrix factorization, which is based on a latent factor model. We propose a novel Euclidean embedding method as an alternative latent factor model to implement collaborative filtering. In this method, users and items are embedded in a unified Euclidean space where the distance between a user and an item is inversely proportional to the rating. This model is comparable to matrix factorization in terms of both scalability and accuracy while providing several advantages. First, the result of Euclidean embedding is more intuitively understandable for humans, allowing useful visualizations. Second, the neighborhood structure of the unified Euclidean space allows very efficient recommendation queries. Finally, the method facilitates online implementation requirements such as mapping new users or items in an existing model.

On the stability of recommendation algorithms,Gediminas Adomavicius (University of Minnesota);Jingjing Zhang (University of Minnesota);,"1988164005,2154615831","The paper introduces stability as a new measure of the recommender systems performance. In general, we define a recommendation algorithm to be ""stable"" if its predictions for the same items are consistent over a period of time, assuming that any new ratings that have been submitted to the recommender system over the same period of time are in complete agreement with system's prior predictions. In this paper, we advocate that stability should be a desired property of recommendation algorithms, because unstable recommendations can lead to user confusion and, therefore, reduce trust in recommender systems. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate stability of several popular recommendation algorithms. Our results suggest that model-based recommendation techniques demonstrate higher stability than memory-based collaborative filtering heuristics. We also find that the stability measure for recommendation techniques is influenced by many factors, including the sparsity of the initial rating data, the number of new incoming ratings (representing the length of the time period over which the stability is being measured), the distribution of the newly added rating values, and the rating normalization procedures employed by the recommendation algorithms.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Learning in efficient tag recommendation,Marek Lipczak (Dalhousie University);Evangelos E. Milios (Dalhousie University);,"36129533,2231563531","The objective of a tag recommendation system is to propose a set of tags for a resource to ease the tagging process done manually by a user. Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing efficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems confirmed the importance of both learning methods.

Aggregating preference graphs for collaborative rating prediction,Maunendra Sankar Desarkar (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur);Sudeshna Sarkar (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur);Pabitra Mitra (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur);,"182844025,2153752568,2144094675","Collaborative filtering is a widely used technique for rating prediction in recommender systems. Memory based collaborative filtering algorithms assign weights to the users to capture similarities between them. The weighted average of similar users' ratings for the test item is output as prediction. We propose a memory based algorithm that is markedly different from the existing approaches. We use preference relations instead of absolute ratings for similarity calculations, as preference relations between items are generally more consistent than ratings across like-minded users. Each user's ratings are viewed as a preference graph. Similarity weights are learned using an iterative method motivated by online learning. These weights are used to create an aggregate preference graph. Ratings are inferred to maximally agree with this aggregate graph. The use of preference relations allows the rating of an item to be influenced by other items, which is not the case in the weighted-average approaches of the existing techniques. This is very effective when the data is sparse, specially for the items rated by few users. Our experiments show that the our method outperforms other methods in the sparse regions. However, for dense regions, sometimes our results are comparable to the competing approaches, and sometimes worse.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,preference learning;collaborative filtering;iterative method;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

These sites often contain overwhelming amounts of information that are also being updated rapidly. To help users locate their interests at such sites (e.g., interesting blogs to read or discussion forums to join), researchers have developed a number of recommendation technologies. However, it is difficult to make effective recommendations for new users (a.k.a. the cold start problem) due to a lack of user information (e.g., preferences and interests). Furthermore, the complexity of recommendation algorithms often prevents users from comprehending let alone trusting the recommended results. To tackle the above two challenges, we are building a social map-based recommender system called Pharos. A social map summarizes users' content-related social behavior over time (e.g., reading, writing, and commenting behavior during the past week) as a set of latent communities. Each community is characterized by the theme of the content being discussed and the key people involved. By discovering, ranking, and displaying the most ""popular"" latent communities, Pharos creates a visual social map of a website. This enables new users to obtain a quick overview of the site, alleviating the cold start problem. Furthermore, we use the social map as a context to help explain Pharos-recommended content and people. Users can also interactively explore the social map to locate their interested content or people that are not being explicitly recommended, compensating for the imperfection in the recommendation algorithms. We have deployed Pharos within our company and our preliminary evaluation shows the usefulness of Pharos.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,cold start;trustworthy computing;interaction;social behavior;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

A belief propagation based recommender system for online services,Erman Ayday (Georgia Institute of Technology);Faramarz Fekri (Georgia Institute of Technology);,"187762966,246792483","In this paper we report our progress in the first application of iterative probabilistic algorithms in the design and evaluation of recommender systems. The proposed iterative recommender system (referred to as BPRS) is based on the belief propagation, a powerful decoding algorithm for turbo codes and Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. The belief propagation algorithm relies on a graph-based representation of an appropriately chosen factor graph for the recommender systems. The factor graph representation of the recommender systems turned out to be a bipartite graph, where the users and products are arranged as two sets of variable and factor nodes that are connected via some edges. Recommendations (predicted ratings) for each particular user can be computed by probabilistic message passing between nodes in the graph. We provide an evaluation of BPRS via computer simulations using the MovieLens dataset. We observed that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of the users until it converges. Further, our initial results indicate an improvement in the Mean Average Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) over the Item Averaging. Therefore, we are confident that the belief propagation is a new promising approach which will offer robustness and accuracy for the recommender systems.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,factor graph;low density parity check code;belief propagation;recommender system;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;machine learning;computer science;

Since computing the optimal minimal set of ratings is computationally intractable, we propose two heuristic algorithms that proceed iteratively that aiming atto minimizing the number of required ratings, until identifying a ""winning item"".

Extending data sets with additional consumption data (from the past) might enrich the user profiles and generally leads to more accurate recommendations. Although if a considerable amount of profile information is already available and detailed personal preferences can be derived, supplementary consumption data may not have any (or a very limited) added value for the recommendation algorithm. These additional consumption data increase the required storage capacity and the computational load to generate the personal recommendations. Moreover, since personal preferences and the relevance of content items may vary over time, older consumption data might be outdated and lead to inaccurate recommendations. Therefore, we investigate which consumption data are (the most) relevant to feed the conventional collaborative filtering algorithms. For provider-generated content systems, we demonstrate that the accuracy of collaborative filtering algorithms increases by extending user profiles with additional older consumption data. In contrast, we witness the opposite effect for user-generated content systems: involving older consumption data has a negative influence on the recommender accuracy. These results are important for website owners who intend to employ a recommendation system at a minimum storage and computation cost.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,user generated content;collaborative filtering;data quality;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

However, recommended items with higher CTR does not imply higher relevance of two items since factors like item popularity or item serendipity may influence user's click behavior. We argue that the relevance of recommendation system is also desirable in many real applications. Here relevant means relevance in a human perceptible way. Relevant recommendations not only increase the users' trust to the system but are extremely useful for the vast number of anonymous user as their recommendations may only be made based on the current item. In this paper, we empirically examine the relation between the relevance of recommendations and the corresponding CTR with a few representative ItemCF algorithms through online data from a TV show/movie website, Hulu. Experiments show that algorithms with higher overall CTR may not correspond to higher relevance. Thus CTR may not be the optimal metric for online evaluation of recommender systems if producing relevant recommendations is of importance.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,click through rate;collaborative filtering;relevance;perception;evaluation;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

In this case, it would be expected that the list returned would contain other animation movies like 'Wall-E', 'Princess Mononoke' etc. Thus, this problem can be viewed as a type of ""clustering on demand"" problem [1]. It is the set form of input that distinguishes this problem from a standard information retrieval problem where the query is usually a single item or an abstraction of a single item in the dataset.

To collect such data, rating or scoring methods that use rating scales, such as good-fair-poor or a five-point-scale, have been employed. We replaced such collection methods with a ranking method, in which objects are sorted according to the degree of a user's preference. We developed a technique to convert the rankings to scores based on order statistics theory. This technique successfully improved the accuracy of ranking recommended items. However, we targeted only memory-based recommendation algorithms. To test whether or not the use of ranking methods and our conversion technique are effective for wide variety of recommenders, we apply our conversion technique to model-based algorithms.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,order statistic;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Personalizing the settings for Cf-based recommender systems,Il Im (Yonsei University);Byung Ho Kim (Yonsei University);,"2659915299,2140848934","In this paper, we propose a new method for collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommender systems. Traditional CF-based recommendation algorithms have applied constant settings such as a reference group (neighborhood) size and a significance level to all users. In this paper we develop a new method that identifies optimal personalized settings for each user and applies them to generating recommendations for individual users. Personalized parameters are identified through iterative simulations with 'training' and 'verification' datasets. The method is compared with traditional 'constant settings' methods using Netflix data. The results show that the new method outperforms traditional, ordinary CF.

Workshop on the practical use of recommender systems algorithms & technology,Jerome Picault (Alcatel-Lucent);Dimitre Kostadinov (Alcatel-Lucent);Pablo Castells (Autonomous University of Madrid);Alejandro Jaimes (Yahoo!);,"1987466523,2205389587,2008802352,2193615068","User modeling, adaptation, and personalization techniques have hit the mainstream. The explosion of social network websites, on-line user-generated content platforms, and the tremendous growth in computational power of mobile devices are generating incredibly large amounts of user data, and an increasing desire of users to ""personalize"" (their desktop, e-mail, news site, phone). The potential value of personalization has become clear both as a commodity for the benefit or enjoyment of end-users, and as an enabler of new or better services -- a strategic opportunity to enhance and expand businesses. An exciting characteristic of recommender systems is that they draw the interest of industry and businesses while posing very interesting research and scientific challenges. In spite of significant progress in the research community, and industry efforts to bring the benefits of new techniques to end-users, there are still important gaps that make personalization and adaptation difficult for users. Research activities still often focus on narrow problems, such as incremental accuracy improvements of current techniques, sometimes with ideal hypotheses, or tend to overspecialize on a few applicative problems (typically TV or movie recommenders -- sometimes simply because of the availability of data). This restrains de facto the range of other applications where personalization technologies might be useful as well. Thus, we may have reached a good point to take a step back to seek perspective in the research done in recommender systems. This workshop contrives for a new uptake on past experiences and lessons learned. We propose an analytic outlook on new research directions, or ones that still require substantial research, with a special focus on their practical adoption in working applications, and the barriers to be met in this path. This workshop is an opportunity to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss, on one hand, the main lessons drawn from successes but also from failures of recommender systems, and on the other hand, identify and analyze the major research areas in recommendation and personalization technologies that should be addressed in the future for a practical, effective take-up of the needs of vendors, consumers, and technology providers. Selected papers fall into the following areas. Limits of recommender systems: main bottlenecks, research dead ends and myths in recommender systems; missing technology pieces for wider adoption; social (privacy, culture) issue. Analytical view of personalization experiences: case studies of recommender system implementations & deployments; evaluation and user studies of recommender systems, scalability in large recommender systems, lessons learnt from your past experience, obstacles to massive deployment of recommendation solutions in industrial environment. Recommender systems in broader systems: place of recommender systems in complete systems, killer application are. Next needs in recommender systems: new business models related to recommendation, social and cultural impact of recommender systems, new paradigms to provide recommendations, new areas for recommendations, users' expectations about future recommender systems, beyond one-shot recommendations: recommendations of sequences, goal-oriented recommendations. The workshop combines short paper presentations with open discussion sessions. Papers are grouped by topics allowing us to organize an open discussion for every topic.

After three fantastic preceding conferences, we took on the challenge of continuing on the success trend knowing that a city such as Barcelona would offer the ideal setting. Not only is Barcelona a top tourism destination but it has also a very bustling industry that includes large companies and young startups in recommender systems and related areas. RecSys is maturing as a research area and you will find several signs of that maturity reflected in these proceedings. One sign is becoming cumulative: performance of new algorithms is compared to previous algorithms and contrasts are made between performance on different datasets. With maturity, however, also comes a questioning of assumptions. For example, you will find papers that argue for different measures of success than prediction accuracy, such as stability and coverage. Despite maturity, the field also continues to be creative. You will find papers exploring new ways of collecting user preferences beyond like/dislike of individual items, such as pairwise orderings or allocation of points among a set of items. You will also find research identifying and exploiting the specific characteristics of non-standard item types to recommend, ranging from people to groups to recipes to research papers. For the first time, ACM RecSys 2010 had more than 200 submissions. Of 129 full paper submissions, 25 were accepted (19.4%) for oral presentation at the conference. Of 78 short paper submissions, 32 were accepted (41.0%) for poster presentation. In addition, we introduced a new track for submission of demos and case study reports, which will also be presented at the poster session. The program also includes three invited tutorials, by senior researchers Joe Konstan, Ricardo Baeza-Yates, and Guy Shani, and an invited keynote by Edouard Servan-Schreiber. The conference begins with an industry panel examining the future of recommender systems in several different industries, and how it relates to search. Panelists from Neo Metrics Barcelona, Bloomberg.com, YouTube, SAP, and Avail Intelligence will join industry chairs Ido Guy and Alex Jaimes on stage. Tuesday morning begins with a panel on contests and challenges. In addition to a skeptic's voice questioning the wisdom of contests overall, the panel will explore alternative tasks for contests besides prediction and ranking, such as making creative use of the outputs of a fixed recommender engine, or eliciting inputs for a recommender engine. In addition to the main program, we would also like to highlight the growing success of the collocated workshops. This year we have seven workshops distributed on two different days of the conference. These workshops include most of the new trending research lines in recommender systems. They focus on application areas of RecSys such as music, e-Learning, or the social web. Others analyze some cross-cutting concerns in research such as how to deal with contextual or heterogeneous information, or how to bring the user into the loop in the evaluation phase. Finally, one workshop specifically focuses on the practical concerns of deploying and evaluating recommender systems in real-world settings.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,operations research;world wide web;artificial intelligence;simulation;computer science;

While most recommender research focuses on improving the accuracy of recommender algorithms, this paper stresses the role of explanations for recommended items for gaining acceptance and trust. Specifically, we present a method which is capable of providing detailed explanations of recommendations while exhibiting reasonable prediction accuracy. The method models the users' ratings as a function of their utility part-worths for those item attributes which influence the users' evaluation behavior, with part-worth being estimated through a set of auxiliary regressions and constrained optimization of their results. We provide evidence that under certain conditions the proposed method is superior to established recommender approaches not only regarding its ability to provide detailed explanations but also in terms of prediction accuracy. We further show that a hybrid recommendation algorithm can rely on the content-based component for a majority of the users, switching to collaborative recommendation only for about one third of the user base.",2010,Conference on Recommender Systems,hybrid algorithm;recommender system;knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Therefore, we utilize the available algorithms and technologies aiming to achieve better accuracy in order to surpass even the most state of the art algorithms. In addition, Hydra can be used to find how algorithms interact with each other in order to estimate the resulting accuracy towards inventing a more precise algorithm diminishing the risk of a failed investment.

In the present work we propose three content-based approaches to this task. Starting from an explicit set of music tracks provided by the user as evidence of his/her music preferences, we infer high-level semantic descriptors, covering dierent musical facets, such as genre, culture, moods, instruments, rhythm, and tempo. On this basis, two of the proposed approaches employ a semantic music similarity measure to generate recommendations. The third approach creates a probabilistic model of the user’s preference in the semantic domain. We evaluate these approaches against two recommenders using state-of-the-art timbral features, and two contextual baselines, one exploiting simple genre categories, the other using similarity information obtained from collaborative ltering. We conduct a listening experiment to assess familiarity, liking and further listening intentions for the provided recommendations. According to the obtained results, we found our semantic approaches to outperform the low-level timbral baselines together with the genre-based recommender. Though the proposed approaches could not reach a performance comparable to the involved collaborative ltering system, they yielded acceptable results in terms of successful novel recommendations.

To this end, we evaluated several existing music recommenders. We wanted to discover which of the six goals (transparency, scrutability, effectiveness, persuasiveness, efficiency and trust) the different UI elements promote in the existing music recommenders, and how they could be measured in order to create a simple framework for evaluating recommender UIs.

They allow users to create tags that annotate and categorize content and share them with other users, very helpful in particular for searching multimedia content. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and annotation guidelines, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. Especially new resources annotated by only a few users have often rather idiosyncratic tags that do not reflect a common perspective useful for search. In this paper we introduce an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for recommending tags of resources in order to improve search. Resources annotated by many users and thus equipped with a fairly stable and complete tag set are used to elicit latent topics to which new resources with only a few tags are mapped. Based on this, other tags belonging to a topic can be recommended for the new resource. Our evaluation shows that the approach achieves significantly better precision and recall than the use of association rules, suggested in previous work, and also recommends more specific tags.

Context-based splitting of item ratings in collaborative filtering,Linas Baltrunas (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano);Francesco Ricci (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano);,"86652860,2146296306","Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations are computed by leveraging a historical data set of users' ratings for items. It assumes that the users' previously recorded ratings can help in predicting future ratings. This has been validated extensively, but in some domains item ratings can be influenced by contextual conditions, such as the time or the goal of the item consumption. This type of information is not exploited by standard CF models. This paper introduces and analyzes a novel pre-filtering technique for context-aware CF called item splitting. In this approach, the ratings of certain items are split, according to the value of an item-dependent contextual condition. Each split item generates two fictitious items that are used in the prediction algorithm instead of the original one. We evaluated this approach on real world and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix-factorization and nearest neighbor CF algorithms. We show that item splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the item selection method and on the influence of the contextual variables on the item ratings.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;synthetic data;matrix decomposition;k nearest neighbors algorithm;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Second, traditional recommender systems ignore the connections among users, which loses the opportunity to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. In this paper, aiming at providing more realistic and accurate recommendations, we propose a factor analysis-based optimization framework to incorporate the user trust and distrust relationships into the recommender systems. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We elaborate how user distrust information can benefit the recommender systems.

Recommending new movies: even a few ratings are more valuable than metadata,István Pilászy (Budapest University of Technology and Economics);Domonkos Tikk (Budapest University of Technology and Economics);,"231266601,165729861","The Netflix Prize (NP) competition gave much attention to collaborative filtering (CF) approaches. Matrix factorization (MF) based CF approaches assign low dimensional feature vectors to users and items. We link CF and content-based filtering (CBF) by finding a linear transformation that transforms user or item descriptions so that they are as close as possible to the feature vectors generated by MF for CF. We propose methods for explicit feedback that are able to handle 140,000 features when feature vectors are very sparse. With movie metadata collected for the NP movies we show that the prediction performance of the methods is comparable to that of CF, and can be used to predict user preferences on new movies. We also investigate the value of movie metadata compared to movie ratings in regards of predictive power. We compare our solely CBF approach with a simple baseline rating-based predictor. We show that even 10 ratings of a new movie are more valuable than its metadata for predicting user ratings.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;matrix decomposition;mean squared error;feature vector;linear map;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

A unified approach to building hybrid recommender systems,Asela Gunawardana (Microsoft);Christopher Meek (Microsoft);,"2104818967,2422299352","Content-based recommendation systems can provide recommendations for ""cold-start"" items for which little or no training data is available, but typically have lower accuracy than collaborative filtering systems. Conversely, collaborative filtering techniques often provide accurate recommendations, but fail on cold start items. Hybrid schemes attempt to combine these different kinds of information to yield better recommendations across the board. We describe unified Boltzmann machines, which are probabilistic models that combine collaborative and content information in a coherent manner. They encode collaborative and content information as features, and then learn weights that reflect how well each feature predicts user actions. In doing so, information of different types is automatically weighted, without the need for careful engineering of features or for post-hoc hybridization of distinct recommender systems. We present empirical results in the movie and shopping domains showing that unified Boltzmann machines can be used to combine content and collaborative information to yield results that are competitive with collaborative techniques in recommending items that have been seen before, and also effective at recommending cold-start items.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,cold start;boltzmann machine;collaborative filtering;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Rate it again: increasing recommendation accuracy by user re-rating,Xavier Amatriain (Telefónica);Josep M.

However, users have been shown to be inconsistent and to introduce a non-negligible amount of natural noise in their ratings that affects the accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve RS accuracy by reducing the natural noise in the input data via a preprocessing step. In order to quantitatively understand the impact of natural noise, we first analyze the response of common recommendation algorithms to this noise. Next, we propose a novel algorithm to denoise existing datasets by means of re-rating: i.e. by asking users to rate previously rated items again. This denoising step yields very significant accuracy improvements. However, re-rating all items in the original dataset is unpractical. Therefore, we study the accuracy gains obtained when re-rating only some of the ratings.In particular, we propose two partial denoising strategies: data and user-dependent denoising. Finally, we compare the value of adding a rating of an unseen item vs. re-rating an item. We conclude with a proposal for RS to improve the quality of their user data and hence their accuracy: asking users to re-rate items might, in some circumstances, be more beneficial than asking users to rate unseen items.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;noise;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

A number of attack models have been proposed and some detection strategies to identify these attacks have been empirically evaluated. In this paper we show that the standard attack models can be readily detected using statistical detection techniques. We argue that insufficient consideration of the effectiveness of attacks under a constraint of statistical invariance has been taken in past research. In fact, it is possible to create effective attacks that are undetectable using the detection strategies proposed to date, including the PCA-based clustering strategy which has shown excellent performance against standard attacks. Nevertheless, these more advanced attacks can also be detected with careful design of a statistical detector. The question posed for future research is whether attack models that produce effective attack profiles that are statistically identical to genuine profiles are really possible.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;robustness;recommender system;world wide web;computer security;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called tag informed collaborative filtering (TagiCoFi), to seamlessly integrate tagging information into the CF procedure.

A spatio-temporal approach to collaborative filtering,Zhengdong Lu (University of Texas at Austin);Deepak Agarwal (Yahoo!);Inderjit S. Dhillon (University of Texas at Austin);,"2704112158,2591515730,2033403132","In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal model for collaborative filtering applications. Our model is based on low-rank matrix factorization that uses a spatio-temporal filtering approach to estimate user and item factors. The spatial component regularizes the factors by exploiting correlation across users and/or items, modeled as a function of some implicit feedback (e.g., who rated what) and/or some side information (e.g., user demographics, browsing history). In particular, we incorporate correlation in factors through a Markov random field prior in a probabilistic framework, whereby the neighborhood weights are functions of user and item covariates. The temporal component ensures that the user/item factors adapt to process changes that occur through time and is implemented in a state space framework with fast estimation through Kalman filtering. Our spatio-temporal filtering (ST-KF hereafter) approach provides a single joint model to simultaneously incorporate both spatial and temporal structure in ratings and therefore provides an accurate method to predict future ratings. To ensure scalability of ST-KF, we employ a mean-field approximation for inference. Incorporating user/item covariates in estimating neighborhood weights also helps in dealing with both cold-start and warm-start problems seamlessly in a single unified modeling framework; covariates predict factors for new users and items through the neighborhood. We illustrate our method on simulated data, benchmark data and data obtained from a relatively new recommender system application arising in the context of Yahoo!

Having this access, however, undermines the users' privacy. The more information is revealed to the server on the user-item relations, the lower the users' privacy is. Yet, hiding part of the profiles to increase the privacy comes at the cost of recommendation accuracy or difficulty of implementing the method. In this paper, we propose a distributed mechanism for users to augment their profiles in a way that obfuscates the user-item connection to an untrusted server, with minimum loss on the accuracy of the recommender system. We rely on the central server to generate the recommendations. However, each user stores his profile offline, modifies it by partly merging it with the profile of similar users through direct contact with them, and only then periodically uploads his profile to the server. We propose a metric to measure privacy at the system level, using graph matching concepts. Applying our method to the Netflix prize dataset, we show the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving the tradeoff between privacy and accuracy in recommender systems in an applicable way.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,privacy software;collaborative filtering;matching;recommender system;internet privacy;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Using a trust network to improve top-N recommendation,Mohsen Jamali (Simon Fraser University);Martin Ester (Simon Fraser University);,"2617375404,2067196623","Top-N item recommendation is one of the important tasks of recommenders. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems which can predict ratings for a given user and item.

In this paper we propose novel methods exploiting a trust network to improve the quality of top-N recommendation. The first method performs a random walk on the trust network, considering the similarity of users in its termination condition.

The preference spectrum defined by items that a user has rated, and ranging from best-liked to most disliked items, is divided into item sets, or RIPs, which supply the basis for a fine-grained calculation of similarity between users. The RIP-based approach makes it possible for the model to take advantage of user tastes that are matched at one end of the spectrum, e.g., two users agree on favorites, without requiring complete correspondence of item ratings between user profiles. The approach improves rating prediction, as compared to a baseline that uses the global user similarity alone. It does not unduly inflate computational complexity or rely on external resources, common shortcomings of competing rating prediction methods. Cases in which the nearest neighbors are relatively dissimilar, known to be challenging for user-based collaborative filtering, demonstrate particularly substantial improvement.

The side-by-side comparison also reveals that users significantly favor the personality-based recommender and have a significantly higher intention to use such a system again. Therefore, we believe that if users accepted rating-based recommenders, they are most likely to accept personality-based recommenders and personality-based recommenders have a high likelihood to be widely adopted despite the fact that rating-based recommenders are now the industry norm.

The basic process consists of matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item). Common-sense and domain-specific knowledge may be useful to give some meaning to the content of items, thus helping to generate more informative features than ""plain"" attributes. The process of learning user profiles could also benefit from the infusion of exogenous knowledge or open source knowledge, with respect to the classical use of endogenous knowledge (extracted from the items themselves). The main contribution of this paper is a proposal for knowledge infusion into content-based recommender systems, which suggests a novel view of this type of systems, mostly oriented to content interpretation by way of the infused knowledge. The idea is to provide the system with the ""linguistic"" and ""cultural"" background knowledge that hopefully allows a more accurate content analysis than classic approaches based on words. A set of knowledge sources is modeled to create a memory of linguistic competencies and of more specific world ""facts"", that can be exploited to reason about content as well as to support the user profiling and recommendation processes.

The overall goal of the project is to examine ways to improve the diversity of recommendations while maintaining high accuracy. During the course of my work to date I have addressed the question of how best to evaluate diversification strategies and have proposed a number of new diversity enhancement algorithms.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,strategy;evaluation;management science;knowledge management;
Tutorial on using social trust for recommender systems,"Jennifer Golbeck (University of Maryland, College Park);",2061781787,"As the Web has shifted to an interactive environment where vast amounts of content is created by users, the question of whom to trust and what information to trust has become both more important and more difficult to answer. At the same time, social networks have become very popular with over a billion accounts shared across hundreds of networks. Social trust relationships, derived from social networks, are uniquely suited to speak to the quality of online information; recommender systems are designed to personalize, sort, aggregate, and highlight information. Merging social networks, trust, and recommender systems can improve the accuracy of recommendations and improve the user's experience. In this tutorial, we will cover the use of social trust in recommender systems. Topics including the computation of trust in social networks, integration of trust into recommender systems, and a discussion of when trust offers benefits and the challenges it presents.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,computational trust;social network;recommender system;knowledge management;world wide web;computer science;

We address both the modeling of reviewer-paper preferences (which can be cast as a learning problem) and the optimization of reviewing assignments to satisfy global conference criteria (which can be viewed as constraint satisfaction). Due to the paucity of preference data per reviewer or per paper (relative to other recommender systems applications) we show how we can integrate multiple sources of information to learn reviewer-paper preference models. Our models are evaluated not just in terms of prediction accuracy but in terms of end-assignment quality. Using a linear programming-based assignment optimization, we show how our approach better explores the space of unsupplied assignments to maximize the overall affinities of papers assigned to reviewers.

Critiquing recommenders for public taste products,Pearl Pu (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);Maoan Zhou (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);Sylvain Castagnos (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);,"2148520950,2228237133,2609499098","Critiquing-based recommenders do not require users to state all of their preferences upfront or rate a set of previously experienced products. Compared to other types of recommenders, they require relatively little user effort, especially initially, despite potential accuracy problems. On the other hand, they rely on a set of critiques to elicit users feedback in order to improve accuracy. Thus the better the critiques are, the more accurately and efficiently the system becomes in generating its recommendations. This method has been successfully applied to high-involvement products. However, it was never tested on public taste products such as music, films, perfumes, fashion goods or wine. Indeed our initial trial adapting traditional critiquing methods to this new domain led to unsatisfactory results. This has motivated us to develop a novel approach named ""editorial picked critiques"" (EPC) that accounts for users' needs for popularity information, editorial suggestions, as well as their needs for personalization and diversity. Through an empirical study, we demonstrate that EPC presents a viable recommender approach and is superior on several dimensions to critiques generated by data mining methods.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,empirical research;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;data mining;computer science;
Collaborative filtering for social tagging systems: an experiment with CiteULike,Denis Parra (University of Pittsburgh);Peter Brusilovsky (University of Pittsburgh);,"2166181490,2032738043","Collaborative tagging systems pose new challenges to the developers of recommender systems. As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of collaborative tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and compared three variants of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike. The first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF) uses Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. The second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering, takes into account the number of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. The third approach explores an innovative way to form the user neighborhood based on a modified version of the Okapi BM25 model over users' tags. Our results suggest that both alterations of CCF are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

We evaluate the proposed approach on a newly-created corpus, involving 146 books and 1060 users.

In our system, component engines are level-1 predictors, and a level-2 predictor is learned to generate the final prediction of the hybrid system. The input features of the level-2 predictor are predictions from component engines and the runtime metrics. Experimental results show that our system outperforms each single component engine as well as a static hybrid system.

One approach to this problem is to use recommender systems that identify user interests through various methods in order to provide information specific to the user's needs. However, many current recommender systems use a collaborative model based on a network of users to provide the recommendations, leading to problems in environments where network relationships are sparse or unknown. Content-based recommenders can avoid the sparsity problem but they may be inefficient for large document collections. In this paper, we propose a concept-based recommender system that recommends papers to general users of the CiteSeerx digital library of Computer Science research publications. We also represent a novel way of classifying documents and creating user profiles based on the ACM (Association for Computer Machinery) classification tree. Based on these user profiles which are built using past click histories, relevant papers in the domain are recommended to users.

Specifically, we hypothesize that users with different levels of domain knowledge prefer different types of PE. While domain experts reported higher satisfaction and perceived usefulness with attribute-based PE (i.e., indicating preference levels for the domain-related attributes), novices preferred case-based PE (i.e., indicating the preference for specific examples, from which attribute-preferences can then be implicitly calculated). The paper discusses the decision-theoretical principles that are believed to lead to this distinction, as well as an experiment that provides substantial evidence for the hypothesis.

The system maintains explicit constraints on user utility based on preferences revealed by the user's actions. We investigate a new decision criterion, setwise minimax regret (SMR) , for constructing optimal recommendation sets: we develop algorithms for computing SMR, and prove that SMR determines choice sets for queries that are myopically optimal. This provides a natural basis for generating compound critiques in conversational recommender systems.

Effective diverse and obfuscated attacks on model-based recommender systems,Zunping Cheng (University College Dublin);Neil Hurley (University College Dublin);,"2143151887,2170692627","Robustness analysis research has shown that conventional memory-based recommender systems are very susceptible to malicious profile-injection attacks. A number of attack models have been proposed and studied and recent work has suggested that model-based collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms have greater robustness against these attacks. Moreover, to combat such attacks, several attack detection algorithms have been proposed. One that has shown high detection accuracy is based on using principal component analysis (PCA) to cluster attack profiles on the basis that such profiles are highly correlated. In this paper, we argue that the robustness observed in model-based algorithms is due to the fact that the proposed attacks have not targeted the specific vulnerabilities of these algorithms. We discuss how an effective attack targeting model-based algorithms that employ profile clustering can be designed. It transpires that the attack profiles employed in this attack, exhibit low rather than high pair-wise similarities and can easily be obfuscated to avoid PCA-based detection, while remaining effective.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,obfuscation;attack;collaborative filtering;principal component analysis;recommender system;world wide web;computer security;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Improving rating estimation in recommender systems using aggregation- and variance-based hierarchical models,Akhmed Umyarov (New York University);Alexander Tuzhilin (New York University);,"1234879716,2057138063","Previous work on using external aggregate rating information showed that this information can be incorporated in several different types of recommender systems and improves their performance. In this paper, we propose a more general class of methods that combine external aggregate information with individual ratings in a novel way. Unlike the previously proposed methods, one of the defining features of this approach is that it takes into the consideration not only the aggregate average ratings but also the variance of the aggregate distribution of ratings. The methods proposed in this paper estimate unknown ratings by finding an optimal linear combination of individual-level and aggregate-level rating estimators in a form of a hierarchical regression (HR) model that is grounded in the theory of statistics and machine learning. The proposed HR model is general enough so that the standard individual-level recommender systems and naive aggregate methods constitute special cases of this model. We show that for the general HR model, the presence of the aggregate variance, surprisingly, does not significantly improve estimation of unknown ratings vis-a-vis the case when only aggregate average ratings are considered. In the paper, we experimentally show that the optimal linear combination approach significantly dominates all other special cases, including the classical non-aggregated case and our previously studied aggregate methods, and therefore is the method of choice.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,predictive modelling;recommender system;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

The present paper describes a simple and effective ensemble regressor for the prediction of missing ratings in recommender systems. The ensemble method is an adaptation of the AdaBoost regression algorithm for recommendation tasks. In all iterations, interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors are simultaneously derived by minimizing the root mean squared error. From iteration to iteration instances that are hard to predict are reinforced by manipulating their weights in the goal function that needs to be minimized.

A spatial model for collaborative filtering of comments in an online discussion forum,"Ephrat Bitton (University of California, Berkeley);",671956753,"This extended abstract presents a new spatial model for collaboratively recommending ""compelling"" comments in an online discussion forum that promote consensus among a diverse group of users.

We propose a model for weighting and aggregating comment ratings that gives greater influence to positive ratings from users who tend to disagree with the commenter, and we compare it with various alternate methods. The model has the added benefit of being resistant to manipulation by false ratings and sybil attacks. We test the model on comments in Opinion Space, a new online discussion tool that allows users to visualize where they stand with respect to other users in terms of their opinions on a set of controversial propositions.

The Social Web has turned information consumers into active contributors who generate large volumes of rapidly changing online data. Recommender Systems strive to identify relevant content for users at the right time and in the right context but achieving this goal has become more difficult, in part due to the volume and nature of information contributed through the Social Web. The emergence of the Social Web marked a change in Web users' attitude to online privacy and sharing. Social media systems encourage users to implicitly and explicitly provide large volumes of information which previously they would have been reluctant to share. This information includes personal details such as location, age, and interests, friendship networks, bookmarks and tags, opinion and preferences which can be captured explicitly or more often by monitoring user interaction with the systems (e.g. commenting, friending, rating,tagging etc). These new sources of knowledge can be leveraged by Recommender Systems to improve existing techniques and develop new strategies which focus on social recommendation. In turn recommender technologies can play a huge part in fuelling the success of the Social Web phenomenon by reducing the information overload problem facing social media users. The goal of this one day workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore, discuss, and understand challenges and new opportunities for Recommender Systems and the Social Web. The workshop consisted both of technical sessions, in which selected participants presented their results or ongoing research, as well as informal breakout sessions on more focused topics. Papers discussing various aspects of recommender system in the Social Web were submitted and selected for presentation and discussion in the workshop in a formal reviewing process. The topics of the submitted papers included, among others, the following main areas: Case studies and novel fielded social recommender applications Economy of community-based systems: Using recommenders to encourage users to contribute and sustain participation Social network and folksonomy development: Recommending friends, tags, bookmarks, blogs, music, communities etc. Recommender system mash-ups, Web 2.0 user interfaces, rich media recommender systems Recommender applications involving users and groups directly in the recommendation process Exploiting folksonomies, social network information, interaction user context and communities or groups for recommendations Trust and reputation aware social recommendations Semantic Web recommender systems, use of ontologies and microformats Empirical evaluation of social recommender techniques, success and failure measures Social recommender systems in the enterprise The list of short papers, the workshop schedule and downloadable versions of the papers can be found at the workshop's homepage at: http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~ssanand/RSWEb.htm and are also published at: http://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,social semantic web;social web;social media;reputation;information overload;collective intelligence;semantic web;trustworthy computing;social system;exponential growth;user interface;social network;recommender system;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;computer science;

Interactive decision aids are becoming indispensable tools assisting users as they search for an ideal product to purchase. For an e-commerce website, adopting the correct tools can affect its survival: effective product recommender tools are increasingly recognized by online stores as effective means to sell more products; on the other hand, sites that do not employ intelligent tools will not only see poor purchase volumes but also experience less traffic because consumers are more likely to return to a site employing recommender systems. This paper presents ongoing research in understanding the impact of various decision aids on users' interaction behaviors and their subjective perceptions of these aids. In the current experiment, we employed an eye tracker in an in-depth user study to understand the influence of recommenders on how users select items for the basket set. We collected more than 20,300 fixation data points in 3,648 areas of interest.

In this work, we consider preference elicitation in the presence of subjective or user-defined features . We treat the problem of learning a user's feature definition as one of concept learning , but whose goal is to learn only enough about the concept definition to enable a good decision to be made. This is complicated by the fact that user preferences are unknown. We describe computational procedures for identifying optimal alternatives w.r.t minimax regret in the presence of both utility and concept uncertainty; and develop several heuristic query strategies that focus on reduction of relevant concept and utility uncertainty.

Second, iTag performs just as well when trained on a single user's blog as when trained on a large corpus of blogs.

Some rush to purchase new products while others tend to be more cautious, waiting for reviews from people they trust. In market analysis, the former group of buyers is often referred to as innovators and early adopters while the latter group is referred to as laggards. The adoption behavior is a dynamic feature of the user and varies over groups of products, e.g., innovators of literature may not be the innovators of electronics. The adoption order of users is a dynamic feature of the product, which can help to predict the future potential buyers. However, such dynamic features are usually unavailable in the description of products. In this paper, we study the user behavior of an online review website- Epinions.com. We first propose to model user adoption behaviors by creating a total ordering among users who rate the products in a given category. We develop a greedy algorithm and a Markov-chain based algorithm for computing the category total ordering. Next, we show that by using user behavior information, we can more accurately predict the category of a new product as well as predict which users will follow. Furthermore, by using the Epinion.com trust network as evidence, we demonstrate that our total ordering can group users into communities that closely resemble the trust network.

Recommendations are made using our Eigentaste 2.0 constant-time collaborative filtering algorithm in combination with a new method for generating a weighted portfolio of recommendations. The key challenge is to generate a customized portfolio that does not necessarily exclude items already rated by the user. Under our method, the weights for items in the portfolio that have not yet been rated by the user are normalized factors of their predicted ratings, and the weights for items previously rated by the user are normalized factors of the actual ratings.

In this working paper we describe our experience developing Donation Dashboard, including the design of the system and our new method for portfolio generation. We use Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) to measure the accuracy of Eigentaste using our dataset of non-profit organization ratings and we compare that with the global mean algorithm.

Uncovering functional dependencies in MDD-compiled product catalogues,Tarik Hadzic (University College Cork);Barry O'Sullivan (University College Cork);,"1964933588,2117866204","A functional dependency is a logical relationship amongst the attributes that define a table of data. Specifically, a functional dependency holds when the values of a subset of the attributes in a dataset determine the values of one or more other attributes. Uncovering such dependencies is utilized in many domains, such as database design. We demonstrate that it can also be utilized in a recommendation context when datasets represent product catalogues. State-of-the-art approaches to discovering functional dependencies require a tabular representation of the data. However, product catalogues can sometimes be defined implicitly, for example, as a set of solutions to a combinatorial problem. Such combinatorial catalogues can have a very large number of products, thus making standard approaches to uncovering functional dependencies inapplicable. In this paper we present the first approach to computing functional dependencies over compiled knowledge representations which can often be small even for huge catalogues. In particular, we develop efficient algorithms that operate over decision diagrams, which allow us to handle catalogues that are out of reach for current approaches. We apply our algorithms to tabular and combinatorial benchmarks and detect a number of properties that could be considered as anomalies in product catalogues.",2009,Conference on Recommender Systems,dependency theory;functional dependency;theoretical computer science;data mining;database;computer science;

Search the web x.0: mining and recommending web-mediated processes,Gabriele Tolomei (Ca' Foscari University of Venice);,2103603267,"Nowadays, people have been increasingly interested in exploiting Web Search Engines (WSEs) not only for having access to simple Web pages, but mainly for accomplishing even complex activities, namely Web-mediated processes (or taskflows).

We claim that such taskflows and their composing tasks are implicitly present in users' minds when they interact with a WSE to access the Web. Our first research challenge is thus to evaluate this belief by analyzing a very large, long-term log of queries submitted to a WSE, and associating meaningful semantic labels with the extracted tasks (i.e., clusters of related queries) and taskflows. This large knowledge base constitutes a good starting point for building a model of users' behaviors. The second research challenge is to devise a novel recommender system that goes beyond the simple query suggestion of modern WSEs.

Burke (DePaul University);,"258628500,2012517146,1892801027,2122091461","Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstrates more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies.",2008,Conference on Recommender Systems,personalization;context dependent memory;complex network;hierarchical clustering;cluster analysis;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Such partitioning eliminates computational dependencies between machines, and thereby communication between them.

Tag recommendations based on tensor dimensionality reduction,"Panagiotis Symeonidis (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki);Alexandros Nanopoulos (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki);Yannis Manolopoulos (University of Maryland, College Park);","2401499786,2076709237,276012958","Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize information items (songs, pictures, web links, products etc.). Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags other users have used for the same items, aiming to develop a common consensus about which tags best describe an item. However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against two state-of-the-art tag recommendations algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision.",2008,Conference on Recommender Systems,latent semantic analysis;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Avoiding monotony: improving the diversity of recommendation lists,Mi Zhang (University College Dublin);Neil Hurley (University College Dublin);,"2248590663,2170692627","The primary premise upon which top-N recommender systems operate is that similar users are likely to have similar tastes with regard to their product choices. For this reason, recommender algorithms depend deeply on similarity metrics to build the recommendation lists for end-users. However, it has been noted that the products offered on recommendation lists are often too similar to each other and attention has been paid towards the goal of improving diversity to avoid monotonous recommendations. Noting that the retrieval of a set of items matching a user query is a common problem across many applications of information retrieval, we model the competing goals of maximizing the diversity of the retrieved list while maintaining adequate similarity to the user query as a binary optimization problem. We explore a solution strategy to this optimization problem by relaxing it to a trust-region problem.This leads to a parameterized eigenvalue problem whose solution is finally quantized to the required binary solution. We apply this approach to the top-N prediction problem, evaluate the system performance on the Movielens dataset and compare it with a standard item-based top-N algorithm. A new evaluation metric ItemNovelty is proposed in this work. Improvements on both diversity and accuracy are obtained compared to the benchmark algorithm.",2008,Conference on Recommender Systems,trust region;metrics;accuracy and precision;optimization problem;recommender system;theoretical computer science;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
"Personalized, interactive tag recommendation for flickr",Nikhil Garg (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);Ingmar Weber (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);,"2160050770,2074066684","We study the problem of personalized, interactive tag recommendation for Flickr: While a user enters/selects new tags for a particular picture, the system suggests related tags to her, based on the tags that she or other people have used in the past along with (some of) the tags already entered. The suggested tags are dynamically updated with every additional tag entered/selected. We describe a new algorithm, called Hybrid, which can be applied to this problem, and show that it outperforms previous algorithms. It has only a single tunable parameter, which we found to be very robust. Apart from this new algorithm and its detailed analysis, our main contributions are (i) a clean methodology which leads to conservative performance estimates, (ii) showing how classical classification algorithms can be applied to this problem, (iii) introducing a new cost measure, which captures the effort of the whole tagging process, (iv) clearly identifying, when purely local schemes (using only a user's tagging history) can or cannot be improved by global schemes (using everybody's tagging history).",2008,Conference on Recommender Systems,world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Social ranking: uncovering relevant content using tag-based recommender systems,Valentina Zanardi (University College London);Licia Capra (University College London);,"2003940327,2105995467","Social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe, categorise, search, discover and navigate content within Web 2.0 websites. Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empower end users by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some content. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introduce. In this paper, we propose Social Ranking, a method that exploits recommender system techniques to increase the efficiency of searches within Web 2.0. We measure users' similarity based on their past tag activity. We infer tags' relationships based on their association to content. We then propose a mechanism to answer a user's query that ranks (recommends) content based on the inferred semantic distance of the query to the tags associated to such content, weighted by the similarity of the querying user to the users who created those tags. A thorough evaluation conducted on the CiteULike dataset demonstrates that Social Ranking neatly improves coverage, while not compromising on accuracy.",2008,Conference on Recommender Systems,web 2 0;similarity;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
A random walk method for alleviating the sparsity problem in collaborative filtering,Hilmi Yildirim (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute);Mukkai S. Krishnamoorthy (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute);,"2157076276,2051314497","Collaborative Filtering is one of the most widely used approaches in recommendation systems which predicts user preferences by learning past user-item relationships. In recent years, item-oriented collaborative filtering methods came into prominence as they are more scalable compared to user-oriented methods. Item-oriented methods discover item-item relationships from the training data and use these relations to compute predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel item-oriented algorithm, Random Walk Recommender, that first infers transition probabilities between items based on their similarities and models finite length random walks on the item space to compute predictions. This method is especially useful when training data is less than plentiful, namely when typical similarity measures fail to capture actual relationships between items. Aside from the proposed prediction algorithm, the final transition probability matrix computed in one of the intermediate steps can be used as an item similarity matrix in typical item-oriented approaches. Thus, this paper suggests a method to enhance similarity matrices under sparse data as well. Experiments on MovieLens data show that Random Walk Recommender algorithm outperforms two other item-oriented methods in different sparsity levels while having the best performance difference in sparse datasets.",2008,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;sparsity of effects principle;sparse matrix;random walk;markov chain;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;
Online-updating regularized kernel matrix factorization models for large-scale recommender systems,Steffen Rendle (University of Hildesheim);Lars Schmidt-Thieme (University of Hildesheim);,"1585981875,78243962","Regularized matrix factorization models are known to generate high quality rating predictions for recommender systems. One of the major drawbacks of matrix factorization is that once computed, the model is static. For real-world applications dynamic updating a model is one of the most important tasks. Especially when ratings on new users or new items come in, updating the feature matrices is crucial. In this paper, we generalize regularized matrix factorization (RMF) to regularized kernel matrix factorization (RKMF). Kernels provide a flexible method for deriving new matrix factorization methods. Furthermore with kernels nonlinear interactions between feature vectors are possible. We propose a generic method for learning RKMF models. From this method we derive an online-update algorithm for RKMF models that allows to solve the new-user/new-item problem. Our evaluation indicates that our proposed online-update methods are accurate in approximating a full retrain of a RKMF model while the runtime of online-updating is in the range of milliseconds even for huge datasets like Netflix.",2008,Conference on Recommender Systems,non negative matrix factorization;matrix decomposition;feature vector;recommender system;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;
A new approach to evaluating novel recommendations,Òscar Celma (Pompeu Fabra University);Perfecto Herrera (Pompeu Fabra University);,"485547008,2106609747","This paper presents two methods, named Item- and User-centric, to evaluate the quality of novel recommendations. The former method focuses on analyzing the item-based recommendation network. The aim is to detect whether the network topology has any pathology that hinders novel recommendations. The latter, user-centric evaluation, aims at measuring users' perceived quality of novel, previously unknown, recommendations. The results of the experiments, done in the music recommendation context, show that last.fm social recommender, based on collaborative filtering, is prone to popularity bias. This has direct consequences on the topology of the item-based recommendation network. Pure audio content-based methods (CB) are not affected by popularity.

The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of user generated content that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this paper, we investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests. The main contribution is a strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques both on the ""official"" item descriptions provided by a publisher, and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests often hidden behind keywords.

Much research to date has focused on improving the performance of this algorithm, without considering the properties that emerge from manipulating the user data in this way. In order to understand the effect of kNN on a user-rating dataset, the algorithm can be viewed as a process that generates a graph, where nodes are users and edges connect similar users: the algorithm generates an implicit social network amongst the system subscribers. Temporal updates of the recommender system will impose changes on the graph.

The context could be a user entering a query in a search engine (""sponsored search""), a user reading a web page (""content match"" and ""display ads""), a user conversing on a cell phone (""mobile advertising""), and so on. The information about the user can vary from scarily detailed to practically nil. The number of potential advertisements might be in the billions. Thus, depending on the definition of ""best match"" this challenge leads to a variety of massive optimization and search problems, with complicated constraints.

We take an expanded perspective on the new user experience, seeing it as an opportunity to elicit valuable contributions to the community and shape subsequent user behavior. We conducted a field experiment in MovieLens where we imposed additional work on new users: not only did they have to rate movies, they also had to enter varying numbers of tags. While requiring more work led to fewer users completing the entry process, the benefits were significant: the remaining users produced a large volume of tags initially, and continued to enter tags at a much higher rate than a control group. Further, their rating behavior was not depressed.

A collaborative constraint-based meta-level recommender,Markus Zanker (Adria Airways);,2295028692,"Recommender Systems (RS) have become popular for their ability to make useful suggestions to online shoppers. Knowledge-based RS represent one branch of these types of applications that employ means-end knowledge to map abstract user requirements to product characteristics. Before setting up such a system, the knowledge has to be acquired from domain experts and formalized using constraints or a comparable representation mechanism. However, the initial acquisition of the knowledge base and its maintenance are effort intensive tasks. Here, we propose a system that learns rule-based preferences from successful interactions in historic transaction data. It is realized as a meta-level hybrid that employs collaborative filtering to derive preferences from a user's nearest neighbors that are processed by a knowledge-based RS to derive recommendations. An evaluation using a commercial dataset showed that this approach outperforms the prediction accuracy of a knowledge base provided by domain experts. In addition, the approach is applicable for supporting domain experts in the maintenance and validation tasks associated with providing personalization knowledge bases.",2008,Conference on Recommender Systems,open knowledge base connectivity;transaction data;user requirements document;collaborative filtering;k nearest neighbors algorithm;recommender system;knowledge base;knowledge based systems;knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;database;machine learning;computer science;

The approach is flexible in several dimensions: We introduce an algorithm where the loss can be tailored to a particular recommender problem. This allows us to optimize the prediction quality in a way that matters for the specific recommender system. The introduced algorithm can deal with structured estimation of the predictions for one user. The most prominent outcome of this is the ability of learning to rank items along user preferences. To this end, we also present a novel algorithm to compute the ordinal loss in O(n log(n)) as apposed to O(n 2 ). We extend this basic model such that it can accommodate user and item offsets as well as user and item features if they are present. The latter unifies collaborative filtering with content based filtering. We present an analysis of the algorithm which shows desirable properties in terms of privacy needs of users, parallelization of the algorithm as well as collaborative filtering as a service. We evaluate the algorithm on data provided by WikiLens. This data is a cross-domain data set as it contains ratings on items from a vast array of categories.

In this paper we investigate foundational questions of social search. In particular, we directly assess the degree of agreement among users about the relevance ranking of search results. We developed a simulated search engine interface that systematically randomizes Google's normal relevance ordering of the items presented to users. Our results show that (a) people are biased toward items in the top of the search lists, even if the list is randomized; (b) people explicit feedback is not biased and (c) people's shared preferences do not always agree with Google's result order.

Therefore, the accuracy of user similarity is the key to the success of the recommendation, both for selecting neighborhoods and computing predictions. However, the computed similarities between users are somewhat inaccurate due to data sparsity. For a given user, the set of neighbors selected for predicting ratings on different items typically exhibit overlap. Thus, error terms contributing to rating predictions will tend to be shared, leading to correlation of the prediction errors. Through a set of case studies, we discovered that for a given user, the prediction errors on different items are correlated to the similarities of the corresponding items, and to the degree to which they share common neighbors. We propose a framework to improve prediction accuracy based on these statistical prediction errors. Two different strategies to estimate the prediction error on a desired item are proposed.

Critique graphs for catalogue navigation,Tarik Hadzic (University College Cork);Barry O'Sullivan (University College Cork);,"1964933588,2117866204","Critique-based conversational recommender systems are becoming common place, facilitating richer dialogues with the user than pure content-based or collaborative approaches. Most implementations of these systems combine similarity-based reasoning with constraints to enable users express preferences as critiques of products. Critiques are simple statements like ""I like this product, but would prefer one that is less expensive"". In this paper we exploit the fact that the repertoire of critiques available to the user is usually known ahead of interaction time to construct a critique graph representation of a catalogue. The critique graph provides a formal basis for reasoning about the set of products that can be reached using critiques from a given product. We introduce the concepts of product cover, support sets of products and catalogue cover. The latter is defined as a set of products from which all products in a catalogue can be reached using a specified best-case maximum number of critiques. We show that for the catalogues we considered, catalogue covers are typically small. We show that the sizes and distributions of product covers and support sets can be used to inform us of the structure of a catalogue and the challenges it would present for interactive navigation. We also propose the notion of a minimum catalogue cover as a set of ""entry products"" that ensure that all products in the catalogue can be reached by critiquing.",2008,Conference on Recommender Systems,graph;recommender system;theoretical computer science;world wide web;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

Implications of psychological phenomenons for recommender systems,Erich Christian Teppan (Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt);,34831310,"Internet users often face the challenge of identifying the most suitable product out of some product assortment available on a certain e-sales platform. Recommender systems can substantially alleviate this typically complex task. Since the rise of such systems a lot of effort has been done in developing different recommendation approaches and algorithms, which all of them have certain strengths and weaknesses. What has been widely ignored by the recommender community so far are the potentials and impacts of psychological and decision theoretical phenomenons, which already have been investigated and applied in the field of marketing. Such phenomenons promise big capability to support users in decision making when facing a comparison situation. This paper concentrates on two classes of phenomenons, which are decoy effects and serial position effects. Tightly coupled to these phenomenons is the problem of getting the utility function of a recommender right, as this function serves both as the basis of result set calculation as well as the fundament of exploitation of above mentioned phenomenons.

While some users faithfully express their true opinion, many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations. The presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Even worse, malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their benefit. Robust statistics is an area within statistics where estimation methods have been developed that deteriorate more gracefully in the presence of unmodeled noise and slight departures from modeling assumptions. In this work, we study how such robust statistical methods, in particular M-estimators, can be used to generate stable recommendation even in the presence of noise and spam. To that extent, we present a Robust Matrix Factorization algorithm and study its stability. We conclude that M-estimators do not add significant stability to recommendation; however the presented algorithm can outperform existing recommendation algorithms in its recommendation quality.",2007,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;robust statistics;matrix decomposition;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Private distributed collaborative filtering using estimated concordance measures,Neal Lathia (University College London);Stephen Hailes (University College London);Licia Capra (University College London);,"2619006089,2051689263,2105995467","Collaborative filtering has become an established method to measure users' similarity and to make predictions about their interests. However, prediction accuracy comes at the cost of user's privacy: in order to derive accurate similarity measures, users are required to share their rating history with each other. In this work we propose a new measure of similarity, which achieves comparable prediction accuracy to the Pearson correlation coefficient, and that can successfully be estimated without breaking users' privacy. This novel method works by estimating the number of concordant, discordant and tied pairs of ratings between two users with respect to a shared random set of ratings. In doing so, neither the items rated nor the ratings themselves are disclosed, thus achieving strictly-private collaborative filtering. The technique has been evaluated using the recently released Netflix prize dataset.",2007,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;correlation;privacy;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
A recursive prediction algorithm for collaborative filtering recommender systems,Jiyong Zhang (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);Pearl Pu (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne);,"2151665331,2148520950","Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful approach for building online recommender systems. The fundamental process of the CF approach is to predict how a user would like to rate a given item based on the ratings of some nearest-neighbor users (user-based CF) or nearest-neighbor items (item-based CF). In the user-based CF approach, for example, the conventional prediction procedure is to find some nearest-neighbor users of the active user who have rated the given item, and then aggregate their rating information to predict the rating for the given item. In reality, due to the data sparseness, we have observed that a large proportion of users are filtered out because they don't rate the given item, even though they are very close to the active user. In this paper we present a recursive prediction algorithm, which allows those nearest-neighbor users to join the prediction process even if they have not rated the given item. In our approach, if a required rating value is not provided explicitly by the user, we predict it recursively and then integrate it into the prediction process. We study various strategies of selecting nearest-neighbor users for this recursive process. Our experiments show that the recursive prediction algorithm is a promising technique for improving the prediction accuracy for collaborative filtering recommender systems.",2007,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;k nearest neighbors algorithm;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Improving new user recommendations with rule-based induction on cold user data,An-Te Nguyen;Nathalie Denos;Catherine Berrut (Joseph Fourier University);,"2342793394,2351835730,2468326231","With recommender systems, users receive items recommended on the basis of their profile. New users experience the cold start problem: as their profile is very poor, the system performs very poorly. In this paper, classical new user cold start techniques are improved by exploiting the cold user data, i.e. the user data that is readily available (e.g. age, occupation, location, etc.), in order to automatically associate the new user with a better first profile. Relying on the existing α-community spaces model, a rule-based induction process is used and a recommendation process based on the ""level of agreement"" principle is defined. The experiments show that the quality of recommendations compares to that obtained after a classical new user technique, while the new user effort is smaller as no initial ratings are asked.",2007,Conference on Recommender Systems,unique user;computer user satisfaction;cold start;user requirements document;user;collaborative filtering;user modeling;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;database;machine learning;computer science;

That is, if two users do not share sufficiently large set of items for whom their ratings are known, then the user-to-user similarity computation is not reliable and a rating prediction for one user can not be based on the ratings of the other. This paper shows that this problem can be solved, and that the accuracy of collaborative recommendations can be improved by: a) partitioning the collaborative user data into specialized and distributed repositories, and b) aggregating information coming from these repositories. This paper explores a content-dependent partitioning of collaborative movie ratings, where the ratings are partitioned according to the genre of the movie and presents an evaluation of four aggregation approaches. The evaluation demonstrates that the aggregation improves the accuracy of a centralized system containing the same ratings and proves the feasibility and advantages of a distributed collaborative filtering scenario.",2007,Conference on Recommender Systems,collaborative filtering;user modeling;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;database;machine learning;computer science;

These recommenders learn a user profile, based on rating feedback from the user on, e.g., books, songs, or TV programs, and use machine learning techniques to infer the ratings of new items. The techniques commonly used are collaborative filtering and naive Bayesian classification, and they are known to have several problems, in particular the cold-start problem and its slow adaptivity to changing user preferences. These problems can be mitigated by allowing the user to set up or manipulate his profile. In this paper, we propose an extension to the naive Bayesian classifier that enhances user control. We do this by maintaining and flexibly integrating two profiles for a user, one learned by rating feedback, and one created by the user. We in particular show how the cold-start problem is mitigated.",2007,Conference on Recommender Systems,user modeling;naive bayes classifier;recommender system;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Users are very often overwhelmed by the huge amount of information and are faced with a big challenge to find the most relevant information in the right time. Recommender systems aim at pruning this information space and directing users toward the items that best meet their needs and interests. Web Recommendation has been an active application area in Web Mining and Machine Learning research. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning perspective toward the problem, based on reinforcement learning. Unlike other recommender systems, our system does not use the static patterns discovered from web usage data, instead it learns to make recommendations as the actions it performs in each situation. We model the problem as Q-Learning while employing concepts and techniques commonly applied in the web usage mining domain. We propose that the reinforcement learning paradigm provides an appropriate model for the recommendation problem, as well as a framework in which the system constantly interacts with the user and learns from her behavior.

Addressing uncertainty in implicit preferences,Sandra Clara Gadanho (Motorola);Nicolas Lhuillier (Motorola);,"2226923829,1242730181","The increasing amount of content available via digital television has made TV program recommenders valuable tools. In order to provide personalized recommendations, recommender systems need to collect information about user preferences. Since users are reluctant to invest much time in explicitly expressing their interests, preferences often need to be implicitly inferred through data gathered by monitoring user behavior. Which is, alas, less reliable. This article addresses the problem of learning TV preferences based on tracking the programs users have watched, whilst dealing with the varying degrees of reliability in such information. Three approaches to the problem are discussed: use all information equally; weight information by its reliability or simply discard the most unreliable information.

To extract these communities a complex network theoretic approach is chosen. A fully connected graph of users is created using epidemic protocols. We show that the created graph sufficiently converges to a graph created with a centralized algorithm after a small number of protocol iterations. To find suitable techniques for creating user communities, we analyze graphs created from real-world recommender datasets and identify specific properties of these datasets. Based on these properties, different graph-based community-extraction techniques are chosen and evaluated. We select a technique that exploits identified properties to create clusters of music listeners. The suitability of this technique is validated using a music dataset and two large movie datasets.

Therefore accurate customer profiles are necessary which nowadays do not exist. In a mobile environment customers are not willing to spend time on disclosing their preferences; maybe they are not aware of them or have difficulties to respond to system requests. The paper in hand follows recommendations by critiquing to improve profiling quality but instead of collecting information, the transparent communication of profile extensions is focused. The customer can add preferences to his profile without explicitly expressing. Furthermore, the connection between proposed preferences and the systems conclusion behind is visible.",2007,Conference on Recommender Systems,profiling;recommender system;multimedia;world wide web;machine learning;computer science;

Creating Models of Real-World Communities with ReferralWeb,Henry Kautz (University of Rochester);,1966271946,"Most recommender systems generate recommendations based on anonymous opinions. This may be fine if the recommendation is about sometime minor, such as which movie to see or which CD to buy. However, when a person is making critical decisions about his life or his business, he does not want anonymous opinions. Instead, he wants the advice of a trusted expert. If he does not personally know such an expert, then he wants a personal reference to such an expert via a series of trusted friends and colleagues. When such a ""referral chain"" can be found, then the person with the question has a good reason to believe the expert’s advice, and the expert has reason to respond to the questioner in a trustworthy manner. Finding experts by referral chaining can be timeconsuming process, particularly if a person is not wellconnected himself. We have created the ReferrMWeb system (Kautz, Selman, and Shah 1997) as a tool aid in finding experts on arbitrary topics. The set of all possible referral chains in a community is called a ""social network"" (Milgram 1967, Wasserman and Galaskiewicz 1994). ReferralWeb lets a user visualize and search such a social network. How can one generate a social network based on a community of interest? Systems such as Firefly (http://www.firefly.net) and 6DOS (http://www.qand-a.com/) require everyone to explicitly register with the system and to provide information about their interests and colleagues. Again, this may be fine if you really want to be restricted to finding experts among the set of people who are highly motivated to join that particular online community. In general, however, you want to find experts who are members of existing ""reM world"" communities. Furthermore, the best, busiest experts are probably the least likely ones to bother to register with any kind of ""expert locator"" service. Therefore it is necessary to generate social networks without the explicit cooperation of any of the people who appear in the networks. ReferralWeb does this by mining information from publicly available documents.",1998,Conference on Recommender Systems,world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
An Interface for Learning Multi-topic User Profiles from Implicit Feedback,Marko Balabanovid;,2332392558,"A text recommender system recommends sets of documents for individual users on the basis of user models, which are incrementally constructed given feedback on previous recommendations. Users are reluctant to take the time to provide such feedback explicitly. One of the contributions of this research is an interface design for a recommender system which infers document preferences by monitoring users’ actions. A second problem for recommender systems is determining the composition of a set of recommendations, especially when users have many interests. The interface presented provides a mechanism for users to define multiple topics of interest and control the proportions between them. Observations from initial usability tests are encouraging--they demonstrate the system successfully learning multi-topic user profiles using only the implicit feedback of users’ clicking and dragand-drop actions.",1998,Conference on Recommender Systems,human computer interaction;multimedia;world wide web;computer science;
Decentralized Social Filtering based on Trust,Tomas Olsson (Swedish Institute of Computer Science);,2477981468,"This paper describes a decentralised approach to social filtering based on trust between agents in a multiagent system. The social filtering in the proposed approach is built on the interactions between collaborative software agents performing content-based filtering. This means that it uses a mixture of content-based and social filtering and thereby, it takes advantage of both methods.",1998,Conference on Recommender Systems,information filtering system;collaborative filtering;software agent;knowledge management;distributed computing;data mining;computer science;
