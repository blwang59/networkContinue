Assessing pattern recognition or labeling in streams of temporal data,Pierre-François Marteau (Sewanee: The University of the South);,2130425563,"In the data deluge context, pattern recognition or labeling in streams is becoming quite an essential and pressing task as data flows inside always bigger streams. The assessment of such tasks is not so easy when dealing with temporal data, namely patterns that have a duration (a beginning and an end time-stamp). This paper details an approach based on an editing distance to first align a sequence of labeled temporal segments with a ground truth sequence, and then, by back-tracing an optimal alignment path, to provide a confusion matrix at the label level. From this confusion matrix, standard evaluation measures can easily be derived as well as other measures such as the "" latency "" that can be quite important in (early) pattern detection applications.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,temporal database;dynamic programming;data mining;database;pattern recognition;computer science;

The analyzed datasets are constituted of a limited set of individuals and a large set of features where predictive biomarkers of clinical outcomes should be mined. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a new hybrid knowledge discovery approach for discovering meaningful predic-tive biological patterns. This hybrid approach combines numerical classifiers such as SVM, Random Forests (RF) and ANOVA, with a symbolic method, namely Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The related experiments show how we can discover among the best potential predictive biomarkers of metabolic diseases thanks to specific combinations of clas-sifiers mainly involving RF and ANOVA. The visualization of predictive biomarkers is based on heatmaps while FCA is mainly used for visual-ization and interpretation purposes, complementing the computational power of numerical methods.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,formal concept analysis;prediction;metabolomics;data science;bioinformatics;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

In numerous real-world applications large datasets are inevitably noisy and contain outliers. These outliers can dramatically degrade the performance of standard machine learning approaches such as regression trees. To this end, we present a novel distributed regression tree approach that utilizes robust regression statistics, statistics that are more robust to outliers, for handling large and noisy data. We propose to integrate robust statistics based error criteria into the regression tree. A data summarization method is developed and used to improve the efficiency of learning regression trees in the distributed setting. We implemented the proposed approach and baselines based on Apache Spark, a popular distributed data processing platform.

However, integrated methods and tools that combine advanced visualization and data mining techniques are rare, and those that exist are often specialized to a single problem or domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel generic method for interactive visual exploration of high-dimensional data. In contrast to most visualization tools, it is not based on the traditional dogma of manually zooming and rotating data. Instead, the tool initially presents the user with an ‘interesting’ projection of the data and then employs data randomization with constraints to allow users to flexibly and intuitively express their interests or beliefs using visual interactions that correspond to exactly defined constraints. These constraints expressed by the user are then taken into account by a projection-finding algorithm to compute a new ‘interesting’ projection, a process that can be iterated until the user runs out of time or finds that constraints explain everything she needs to find from the data. We present the tool by means of two case studies, one controlled study on synthetic data and another on real census data.

Do Street Fairs Boost Local Businesses? A Quasi-Experimental Analysis Using Social Network Data,Ke Zhang (University of Pittsburgh);Konstantinos Pelechrinis (University of Pittsburgh);,"2288398844,155875377","Local businesses and retail stores are a crucial part of local economy. Local governments design policies for facilitating the growth of these businesses that can consequently have positive externalities on the local community. However, many times these policies have completely opposite from the expected results (e.g., free curb parking instead of helping businesses has been illustrated to actually hurt them due to the small turnover per spot). Hence, it is important to evaluate the outcome of such policies in order to provide educated decisions for the future. In the era of social and ubiquitous computing, mobile social media, such as Foursquare, form a platform that can help towards this goal. Data from these platforms capture semantic information of human mobility from which we can distill the potential economic activities taking place. In this paper we focus on street fairs (e.g., arts festivals) and evaluate their ability to boost economic activities in their vicinity. In particular, we collected data from Foursquare for the three month period between June 2015 and August 2015 from the city of Pittsburgh. During this period several street fairs took place. Using these events as our case study we analyzed the data utilizing propensity score matching and a quasi- experimental technique inspired by the difference-in-differences method. Our results indicate that street fairs provide positive externalities to nearby businesses. We further analyzed the spatial reach of this impact and we find that it can extend up to 0.6 miles from the epicenter of the event.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;simulation;

We demonstrate an approach to analyzing football data with the aim to find typical patterns of spatial arrangement of the field players. It involves transformation of original coordinates to relative positions of the players and the ball with respect to the center and attack vector of each team. From these relative positions, we derive features for characterizing spatial configurations in different time steps during a football game. We apply clustering to these features, which groups the spatial configurations by similarity. By summarizing groups of similar configurations, we obtain representation of spatial arrangement patterns practiced by each team. The patterns are represented visually by density maps built in the teams’ relative coordinate systems.

To simultaneously recognize new data categories and assign most appropriate category labels to the data actually from known categories, existing models assume the number of unknown new categories is pre-specified, though it is difficult to determine in advance. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric topic model to automatically infer this number, based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process and the notion of latent Dirichlet allocation. Exact inference in our model is intractable, so we provide an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for approximate posterior inference. Extensive experiments on various text data sets show that: a compared with parametric approaches that use pre-specified true number of new categories, the proposed nonparametric approach can yield comparable performance; and b when the exact number of new categories is unavailable, i.e. the parametric approaches only have a rough idea about the new categories, our approach has evident performance advantages.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

Such networks have been widely used in many domains like computer vision and speech recognition, but only a little for time series classification. We design a convolu-tional neural network that consists of two convolutional layers. One drawback with CNN is that they need a lot of training data to be efficient. We propose two ways to circumvent this problem: designing data-augmentation techniques and learning the network in a semi-supervised way using training time series from different datasets.

The goal is to define a decision strategy that maximizes the cumulative reward of actions over time. We focus on the specific case where the features of each action correspond to some kind of a constant profile, which can be used to determine its intrinsic utility for the task in concern. If there exists an unknown linear application that allows rewards to be mapped from profiles, this can be leveraged to greatly improve the exploitation-exploration trade-off of stationary stochastic methods like UCB. In this paper, we consider the case where action profiles are unknown beforehand. Instead, the agent only observes sample vectors, with mean equal to the true profiles, for a subset of actions at each decision step. We propose a new algorithm, called SampLinUCB, and derive a finite time high probability upper bound on its regret.

By construction , the greedification of such a pseudo-value induces the same policy as the value function itself. The approach assumes that, thanks to prior knowledge, not-to-be-imitated demonstrations can easily be generated. For instance, applying a random policy on a good initial state (e.g., a bicycle in equilibrium) will on average lead to visit states with decreasing values (the bicycle ultimately falls down). Such a demonstration , that is, a sequence of states with decreasing values, is used along a standard learning-to-rank approach to define a pseudo-value function. If the model of the environment is known, this pseudo-value directly induces a policy by greedification. Otherwise, the bad demonstrations are exploited together with off-policy learning to learn a pseudo-Q-value function and likewise thence derive a policy by greedification. To our best knowledge the use of bad demonstrations to achieve policy learning is original. The theoretical analysis shows that the loss of optimality of the pseudo value-based policy is bounded under mild assumptions, and the empirical validation of AIPoL on the mountain car, the bicycle and the swing-up pendulum problems demonstrates the simplicity and the merits of the approach.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,q learning;management science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;computer science;mathematics;

Cost-Aware Early Classification of Time Series,Romain Tavenard (Idiap Research Institute);Simon Malinowski;,"138929054,2613014382","In time series classification, two antagonist notions are at stake. On the one hand, in most cases, the sooner the time series is classified , the more rewarding. On the other hand, an early classification is more likely to be erroneous. Most of the early classification methods have been designed to take a decision as soon as sucient level of reliability is reached. However, in many applications, delaying the decision with no guarantee that the reliability threshold will be met in the future can be costly. Recently, a framework dedicated to optimizing a trade-off between classification accuracy and the cost of delaying the decision was proposed, together with an algorithm that decides online the optimal time instant to classify an incoming time series. On top of this framework , we build in this paper two di↵erent early classification algorithms that optimize a trade-off between decision accuracy and the cost of delaying the decision. These algorithms are non-myopic in the sense that, even when classification is delayed, they can provide an estimate of when the optimal classification time is likely to occur. Our experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches are more robust than existing methods.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,one class classification;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

Linear Convergence of Gradient and Proximal-Gradient Methods Under the Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz Condition,Hamed Karimi (University of British Columbia);Julie Nutini (University of British Columbia);Mark W.

This condition is a special case of the \L{}ojasiewicz inequality proposed in the same year, and it does not require strong convexity (or even convexity). In this work, we show that this much-older Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality is actually weaker than the main conditions that have been explored to show linear convergence rates without strong convexity over the last 25 years. We also use the PL inequality to give new analyses of randomized and greedy coordinate descent methods, sign-based gradient descent methods, and stochastic gradient methods in the classic setting (with decreasing or constant step-sizes) as well as the variance-reduced setting. We further propose a generalization that applies to proximal-gradient methods for non-smooth optimization, leading to simple proofs of linear convergence of these methods. Along the way, we give simple convergence results for a wide variety of problems in machine learning: least squares, logistic regression, boosting, resilient backpropagation, L1-regularization, support vector machines, stochastic dual coordinate ascent, and stochastic variance-reduced gradient methods.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,stochastic gradient descent;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;mathematical optimization;mathematics;

We propose a method that utilizes both the manifold structure of data and local discriminant information. Specifically, we define a local clique for each data point. The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is used to determine the structural information within each clique. We then employ a variant of Fisher criterion model to each clique for local discriminant evaluation and sum all cliques as global integration into the framework. In this way, local discriminant information is embedded. Labels are also utilized to minimize distances between data from the same class.

We share the belief that increasing STEM presence in the form of introducing career role models who share similar interests and demographics will inspire students to develop interests in STEM related fields and emulate their models.

We motivate the problem, propose an intuitive formulation and algorithm, and apply our methods to real-world scenarios. Across several domains, we show how using only proportion constraints and no labeled examples, we can achieve surprisingly high accuracy.

Discovering topically- and temporally-coherent events in interaction networks,Han Xiao;Polina Rozenshtein (Aalto University);Aristides Gionis (Aalto University);,"2427284692,285511381,737311942","With the increasing use of online communication platforms, such as email, twitter, and messaging applications, we are faced with a growing amount of data that combine content (what is said), time (when), and user (by whom) information. An important computational challenge is to analyze these data, discover meaningful patterns, and understand what is happening. We consider the problem of mining online communication data and finding top-k temporal events. We define a temporal event to be a coherent topic that is discussed frequently, in a relatively short time span, while the information ow of the event respects the underlying network structure. We construct our model for detecting temporal events in two steps. We first introduce the notion of interaction meta-graph, which connects associated interactions. Using this notion, we define a temporal event to be a subset of interactions that (i) are topically and temporally close and (ii) correspond to a tree that captures the information ow. Finding the best temporal event leads to budget version of the prize-collecting Steiner-tree (PCST) problem, which we solve using three different methods: a greedy approach, a dynamic-programming algorithm, and an adaptation to an existing approximation algorithm. The problem of finding the top- k events among a set of candidate events maps to maximum set-cover problem, and thus, solved by greedy. We compare and analyze our algorithms in both synthetic and real datasets, such as twitter and email communication. The results show that our methods are able to detect meaningful temporal events.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,social network analysis;data science;world wide web;social science;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
On the Convergence of A Family of Robust Losses for Stochastic Gradient Descent,"Bo Han (University of Technology, Sydney);Ivor W.

However, vanilla SGD methods using convex losses cannot perform well with noisy labels, which adversely affect the update of the primal variable in SGD methods. Unfortunately, noisy labels are ubiquitous in real world applications such as crowdsourcing. To handle noisy labels, in this paper, we present a family of robust losses for SGD methods. By employing our robust losses, SGD methods successfully reduce negative effects caused by noisy labels on each update of the primal variable. We not only reveal that the convergence rate is O(1/T) for SGD methods using robust losses, but also provide the robustness analysis on two representative robust losses. Comprehensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show that SGD methods using robust losses are obviously more robust than other baseline methods in most situations with fast convergence.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;
F-measure Maximization in Multi-Label Classification with Conditionally Independent Label Subsets,Maxime Gasse (University of Lyon);Alex Aussem (University of Lyon);,"1976669570,1210402752","We discuss a method to improve the exact F-measure maximization algorithm called GFM, proposed in (Dembczynski et al. 2011) for multi-label classification, assuming the label set can be can partitioned into conditionally independent subsets given the input features. If the labels were all independent, the estimation of only $m$ parameters ($m$ denoting the number of labels) would suffice to derive Bayes-optimal predictions in $O(m^2)$ operations. In the general case, $m^2+1$ parameters are required by GFM, to solve the problem in $O(m^3)$ operations. In this work, we show that the number of parameters can be reduced further to $m^2/n$, in the best case, assuming the label set can be partitioned into $n$ conditionally independent subsets. As this label partition needs to be estimated from the data beforehand, we use first the procedure proposed in (Gasse et al. 2015) that finds such partition and then infer the required parameters locally in each label subset. The latter are aggregated and serve as input to GFM to form the Bayes-optimal prediction. We show on a synthetic experiment that the reduction in the number of parameters brings about significant benefits in terms of performance.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;
The Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian Distribution: Properties and Applications,Farideh Fazayeli (University of Minnesota);Arindam Banerjee (University of Minnesota);,"121178333,2037585042","While the Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian ($\mathcal{MGIG}$) distribution arises naturally in some settings as a distribution over symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, certain key properties of the distribution and effective ways of sampling from the distribution have not been carefully studied. In this paper, we show that the $\mathcal{MGIG}$ is unimodal, and the mode can be obtained by solving an Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) equation [7]. Based on the property, we propose an importance sampling method for the $\mathcal{MGIG}$ where the mode of the proposal distribution matches that of the target. The proposed sampling method is more efficient than existing approaches [32, 33], which use proposal distributions that may have the mode far from the $\mathcal{MGIG}$'s mode. Further, we illustrate that the the posterior distribution in latent factor models, such as probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) [25], when marginalized over one latent factor has the $\mathcal{MGIG}$ distribution. The characterization leads to a novel Collapsed Monte Carlo (CMC) inference algorithm for such latent factor models.

Such a system recursively splits the set of classes into two subsets, and trains a binary classifier to distinguish between each subset. Even though ensembles of nested dichotomies with random structure have been shown to perform well in practice, using a more sophisticated class subset selection method can be used to improve classification accuracy. We investigate an approach to this problem called random-pair selection, and evaluate its effectiveness compared to other published methods of subset selection.

Here we consider a generalization of such MDP planners by taking model uncertainty into account. As model uncertainty can also be formalized as an information-processing constraint, we can derive a unified solution from a single generalized variational principle. We provide a generalized value iteration scheme together with a convergence proof. As limit cases, this generalized scheme includes standard value iteration with a known model, Bayesian MDP planning, and robust planning.

An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Frequent Sequence with Constraint Programming,John O. R. Aoga;Tias Guns (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven);Pierre Schaus;,"2298821486,2087834039,2669477403","The main advantage of Constraint Programming (CP) approaches for sequential pattern mining (SPM) is their modularity, which includes the ability to add new constraints (regular expressions, length restrictions, etc). The current best CP approach for SPM uses a global constraint (module) that computes the projected database and enforces the minimum frequency; it does this with a filtering algorithm similar to the PrefixSpan method. However, the resulting system is not as scalable as some of the most advanced mining systems like Zaki's cSPADE. We show how, using techniques from both data mining and CP, one can use a generic constraint solver and yet outperform existing specialized systems. This is mainly due to two improvements in the module that computes the projected frequencies: first, computing the projected database can be sped up by pre-computing the positions at which an symbol can become unsupported by a sequence, thereby avoiding to scan the full sequence each time; and second by taking inspiration from the trailing used in CP solvers to devise a backtracking-aware data structure that allows fast incremental storing and restoring of the projected database. Detailed experiments show how this approach outperforms existing CP as well as specialized systems for SPM, and that the gain in efficiency translates directly into increased efficiency for other settings such as mining with regular expressions.",2016,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,theoretical computer science;data mining;database;algorithm;computer science;

We view these data as a stream $(x^{(t)})_{t = 1}^n$ of $n$ observations from an unknown distribution $P$, where $x^{(t)} \in [M]^K$ is a $K$-dimensional vector and $M$ is the cardinality of its entries, which is very large. Suppose that the graphical model $\mathcal{G}$ of $P$ is known, and let $\bar{P}$ be the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) of $P$ from $(x^{(t)})_{t = 1}^n$ conditioned on $\mathcal{G}$. In this work, we design and analyze algorithms that approximate $\bar{P}$ with $\hat{P}$, such that $\hat{P}(x) \approx \bar{P}(x)$ for any $x \in [M]^K$ with a high probability, and crucially in the space independent of $M$. The key idea of our approximations is to use the structure of $\mathcal{G}$ and approximately estimate its factors by ""sketches"". The sketches hash high-cardinality variables using random projections. Our approximations are computationally and space efficient, being independent of $M$. Our error bounds are multiplicative and provably improve upon those of the count-min (CM) sketch, a state-of-the-art approach to estimating the frequency of values in a stream, in a class of naive Bayes models.

Machine learning assists the classification of reports by citizens on disease-carrying mosquitoes,Antonio Rodriguez Garcia;Frederic Bartumeus;Ricard Gavaldà Mestre;,"2665781251,2620883405,2706205729","Mosquito Alert (www.mosquitoalert.com/en) is an expert-validated citizen science platform for tracking and controlling disease-carrying mosquitoes. Citizens download a free app and use their phones to send reports of presumed sightings of two world-wide disease vector mosquito species (the Asian Tiger and the Yellow Fever mosquito). These reports are then supervised by a team of entomologists and, once validated, added to a database. As the platform prepares to scale to much larger geographical areas and user bases, the expert validation by entomologists becomes the main bottleneck. In this paper we describe the use of machine learning on the citizen reports to automatically validate a fraction of them, therefore allowing the entomologists either to deal with larger report streams or to concentrate on those that are more strategic, such as reports from new areas (so that early warning protocols are activated) or from areas with high epidemiological risks (so that control actions to reduce mosquito populations are activated). The current prototype flags a third of the reports as “almost certainly positive” with high confidence.

adaQN: An Adaptive Quasi-Newton Algorithm for Training RNNs,Nitish Shirish Keskar (Northwestern University);Albert S. Berahas (Northwestern University);,"2337946745,2548777630","Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful models that achieve exceptional performance on several pattern recognition problems. However, the training of RNNs is a computationally difficult task owing to the well-known ""vanishing/exploding"" gradient problem. Algorithms proposed for training RNNs either exploit no (or limited) curvature information and have cheap per-iteration complexity, or attempt to gain significant curvature information at the cost of increased per-iteration cost. The former set includes diagonally-scaled first-order methods such as ADAGRAD and ADAM, while the latter consists of second-order algorithms like Hessian-Free Newton and K-FAC. In this paper, we present adaQN, a stochastic quasi-Newton algorithm for training RNNs. Our approach retains a low per-iteration cost while allowing for non-diagonal scaling through a stochastic L-BFGS updating scheme. The method uses a novel L-BFGS scaling initialization scheme and is judicious in storing and retaining L-BFGS curvature pairs. We present numerical experiments on two language modeling tasks and show that adaQN is competitive with popular RNN training algorithms.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,machine learning;simulation;mathematical optimization;statistics;mathematics;
A Bayesian Network Model for Interesting Itemsets,Jaroslav M. Fowkes (University of Edinburgh);Charles A.

The most recent models of interestingness are predominantly based on maximum entropy distributions over items or tile entries with itemset constraints, and while computationally tractable are not easily interpretable. We therefore propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, generative model over itemsets, in the form of a Bayesian network, and an associated novel measure of interestingness. Our model is able to efficiently infer interesting itemsets directly from the transaction database using structural EM, in which the E-step employs the greedy approximation to weighted set cover.

A viable solution seems to be the radical turn towards renewable resources.

In this paper four case studies, namely Switzerland, Austria, Greece and north Italy, are examined, applying the method of degree-days. The scarcity of meteorological stations at higher altitudes has been overcome by calculating the lapse rates decrease of surface temperature with altitude for each case, which were found to vary from the common ""rule"" of 6.5i¾?C/km.

In order to minimize production costs, reduce the impact on the environment, and optimize electricity pricing, producers need to be able to accurately estimate their customers' demand. As a result, forecasting electricity usage plays an important role in smart grids since it enables matching supply with demand, and thus minimize energy waste. Forecasting is becoming increasingly important in very small-scale power networks, also known as microgrids, as these systems should be able to operate autonomously, in islanded mode. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of several forecasting methods in such very small networks.

When is undersampling effective in unbalanced classification tasks,Andrea Dal Pozzolo (Université libre de Bruxelles);Olivier Caelen (Atos);Gianluca Bontempi (Université libre de Bruxelles);,"2046583892,2066682242,2295622617","A well-known rule of thumb in unbalanced classification rec- ommends the rebalancing (typically by resampling) of the classes before proceeding with the learning of the classifier. Though this seems to work for the majority of cases, no detailed analysis exists about the impact of undersampling on the accuracy of the final classifier. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing an integrated analysis of the two elements which have the largest impact on the effectiveness of an undersampling strat- egy: the increase of the variance due to the reduction of the number of samples and the warping of the posterior distribution due to the change of priori probabilities. In particular we will propose a theoretical anal- ysis specifying under which conditions undersampling is recommended and expected to be effective. It emerges that the impact of undersam- pling depends on the number of samples, the variance of the classifier, the degree of imbalance and more specifically on the value of the poste- rior probability. This makes difficult to predict the average effectiveness of an undersampling strategy since its benefits depend on the distribu- tion of the testing points.

Instead, to characterize scientific impact, we address two analogous questions asked by many scientific researchers: ""How will my h-index evolve over time, and which of my previously or newly published papers will contribute to it?"" To answer these questions, we perform two related tasks. First, we develop a model to predict authors' future h-indices based on their current scientific impact. Second, we examine the factors that drive papers--either previously or newly published--to increase their authors' predicted future h-indices. By leveraging relevant factors, we can predict an author's h-index in five years with an $$R^2$$ value of 0.92 and whether a previously newly published paper will contribute to this future h-index with an $$F_1$$ score of 0.99 0.77. We find that topical authority and publication venue are crucial to these effective predictions, while topic popularity is surprisingly inconsequential.

Superset Learning Based on Generalized Loss Minimization,Eyke Hüllermeier (University of Paderborn);Weiwei Cheng (Amazon.com);,"323026139,2116283648","In standard supervised learning, each training instance is associated with an outcome from a corresponding output space e.g., a class label in classification or a real number in regression. In the superset learning problem, the outcome is only characterized in terms of a superset--a subset of candidates that covers the true outcome but may also contain additional ones. Thus, superset learning can be seen as a specific type of weakly supervised learning, in which training examples are ambiguous. In this paper, we introduce a generic approach to superset learning, which is motivated by the idea of performing model identification and ""data disambiguation"" simultaneously. This idea is realized by means of a generalized risk minimization approach, using an extended loss function that compares precise predictions with set-valued observations. As an illustration, we instantiate our meta learning technique for the problem of label ranking, in which the output space consists of all permutations of a fixed set of items.

Unfortunately, factorization machines involve a non-convex optimization problem and are thus subject to bad local minima. In this paper, we propose a convex formulation of factorization machines based on the nuclear norm. Our formulation imposes fewer restrictions on the learned model and is thus more general than the original formulation. To solve the corresponding optimization problem, we present an efficient globally-convergent two-block coordinate descent algorithm.

CDRs data analysis has received much attention in the recent years since it might reveal valuable information about human behavior. It has shown high added value in many application domains like e.g., communities analysis or network planning. In this paper, we suggest a generic methodology based on data grid models for summarizing information contained in CDRs data. The method is based on a parameter-free estimation of the joint distribution of the variables that describe the calls. We also suggest several well-founded criteria that allows one to browse the summary at various granularities and to explore the summary by means of insightful visualizations.

Safe exploration is especially important for data sampling from technical and industrial systems, e.g. combustion engines and gas turbines, where critical and unsafe measurements need to be avoided. The objective is to learn data-based regression models from such technical systems using a limited budget of measured, i.e. labelled, points while ensuring that critical regions of the considered systems are avoided during measurements. We propose an approach for learning such models and exploring new data regions based on Gaussian processes GP's. In particular, we employ a problem specific GP classifier to identify safe and unsafe regions, while using a differential entropy criterion for exploring relevant data regions. A theoretical analysis is shown for the proposed algorithm, where we provide an upper bound for the probability of failure. To demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our safe exploration scheme in the active learning setting, we test the approach on a policy exploration task for the inverse pendulum hold up problem.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,machine learning;simulation;mathematical optimization;

One way of learning underlying structures over labels is to project both instances and labels into the same space where an instance and its relevant labels tend to have similar representations. In this paper, we present a novel method to learn a joint space of instances and labels by leveraging a hierarchy of labels. We also present an efficient method for pretraining vector representations of labels, namely label embeddings, from large amounts of label co-occurrence patterns and hierarchical structures of labels. This approach also allows us to make predictions on labels that have not been seen during training. We empirically show that the use of pretrained label embeddings allows us to obtain higher accuracies on unseen labels even when the number of labels are quite large.

Semi-supervised Subspace Co-Projection for Multi-class Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation,Min Xiao (Temple University);Yuhong Guo (Temple University);,"2145269317,2256485367","Heterogeneous domain adaptation aims to exploit labeled training data from a source domain for learning prediction models in a target domain under the condition that the two domains have different input feature representation spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised subspace co-projection method to address multi-class heterogeneous domain adaptation. The proposed method projects the instances of the two domains into a co-located latent subspace to bridge the feature divergence gap across domains, while simultaneously training prediction models in the co-projected representation space with labeled training instances from both domains. It also exploits the unlabeled data to promote the consistency of co-projected subspaces from the two domains based on a maximum mean discrepancy criterion. Moreover, to increase the stability and discriminative informativeness of the subspace co-projection, we further exploit the error-correcting output code schemes to incorporate more binary prediction tasks shared across domains into the learning process. We formulate this semi-supervised learning process as a non-convex joint minimization problem and develop an alternating optimization algorithm to solve it. To investigate the empirical performance of the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on cross-lingual text classification and cross-domain digit image classification tasks with heterogeneous feature spaces. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on these heterogeneous domain adaptation problems.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;

Generalized Matrix Factorizations as a Unifying Framework for Pattern Set Mining: Complexity Beyond Blocks,Pauli Miettinen (Max Planck Society);,2015634213,"Matrix factorizations are a popular tool to mine regularities from data. There are many ways to interpret the factorizations, but one particularly suited for data mining utilizes the fact that a matrix product can be interpreted as a sum of rank-1 matrices. Then the factorization of a matrix becomes the task of finding a small number of rank-1 matrices, sum of which is a good representation of the original matrix. Seen this way, it becomes obvious that many problems in data mining can be expressed as matrix factorizations with correct definitions of what a rank-1 matrix and a sum of rank-1 matrices mean. This paper develops a unified theory, based on generalized outer product operators, that encompasses many pattern set mining tasks. The focus is on the computational aspects of the theory and studying the computational complexity and approximability of many problems related to generalized matrix factorizations. The results immediately apply to a large number of data mining problems, and hopefully allow generalizing future results and algorithms, as well.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,matrix of ones;integer matrix;theoretical computer science;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;mathematics;

Examples include online social networks recording interactions between individuals, sensor networks logging information exchanges between sensors, and more. There is a large body of literature on computing exact or approximate properties on large networks, although most methods assume static networks. On the other hand, in most modern real-world applications, networks are highly dynamic and continuous interactions along existing connections are generated. Furthermore, it is desirable to consider that old edges become less important, and their contribution to the current view of the network diminishes over time. We study the problem of maintaining the neighborhood profile of each node in an interaction network. Maintaining such a profile has applications in modeling network evolution and monitoring the importance of the nodes of the network over time. We present an online streaming algorithm to maintain neighborhood profiles in the sliding-window model. The algorithm is highly scalable as it permits parallel processing and the computation is node centric, hence it scales easily to very large networks on a distributed system, like Apache Giraph. We present results from both serial and parallel implementations of the algorithm for different social networks.

Hyperparameter Search Space Pruning --- A New Component for Sequential Model-Based Hyperparameter Optimization,Martin Wistuba (University of Hildesheim);Nicolas Schilling (University of Hildesheim);Lars Schmidt-Thieme (University of Hildesheim);,"2114698921,2019736652,78243962","The optimization of hyperparameters is often done manually or exhaustively but recent work has shown that automatic methods can optimize hyperparameters faster and even achieve better final performance. Sequential model-based optimization SMBO is the current state of the art framework for automatic hyperparameter optimization. Currently, it consists of three components: a surrogate model, an acquisition function and an initialization technique. We propose to add a fourth component, a way of pruning the hyperparameter search space which is a common way of accelerating the search in many domains but yet has not been applied to hyperparameter optimization. We propose to discard regions of the search space that are unlikely to contain better hyperparameter configurations by transferring knowledge from past experiments on other data sets as well as taking into account the evaluations already done on the current data set. Pruning as a new component for SMBO is an orthogonal contribution but nevertheless we compare it to surrogate models that learn across data sets and extensively investigate the impact of pruning with and without initialization for various state of the art surrogate models. The experiments are conducted on two newly created meta-data sets which we make publicly available. One of these meta-data sets is created on 59 data sets using 19 different classifiers resulting in a total of about 1.3 million experiments.

Flexible Sliding Windows for Kernel Regression Based Bus Arrival Time Prediction,Hoang Thanh Lam (IBM);Eric Bouillet (IBM);,"2118785635,2038428474","Given a set of historical bus trajectories D and a partially observed bus trajectory S up to position l on the bus route, kernel regression KR is a non-parametric approach which predicts the arrival time of the bus at location $$l+h$$$$h>0$$ by averaging the arrival times observed at same location in the past. The KR method does not weights the historical data equally but it gives more preference to the more similar trajectories in the historical data. This method has been shown to outperform the baseline methods such as linear regression or k-nearest neighbour algorithms for bus arrival time prediction problems [9]. However, the performance of the KR approach is very sensitive to the method of evaluating similarity between trajectories. General kernel regression algorithm looks back to the entire trajectory for evaluating similarity. In the case of bus arrival time prediction, this approach does not work well when outdated part of the trajectories does not reflect the most recent behaviour of the buses. In order to solve this issue, we propose an approach that considers only recent part of the trajectories in a sliding window for evaluating the similarity between them. The approach introduces a set of parameters corresponding to the window lengths at every position along the bus route determining how long we should look back into the past for evaluating the similarity between trajectories. These parameters are automatically learned from training data. Nevertheless, parameter learning is a time-consuming process given large training data at least quadratic in the training size. Therefore, we proposed an approximation algorithm with guarantees on error bounds to learn the parameters efficiently. The approximation algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than the exact algorithm. In an experiment with a real-world application deployed for Dublin city, our approach significantly reduced the prediction error compared to the state of the art kernel regression algorithm.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;machine learning;simulation;statistics;computer science;

Indeed, in many application domains, the earliest the decision, the more rewarding it can be. Yet, often, gathering more information allows one to get a better decision. The optimization of this time vs. accuracy tradeoff must generally be solved online and is a complex problem. This paper presents a formal criterion that expresses this trade-off in all generality together with a generic sequential meta algorithm to solve it. This meta algorithm is interesting in two ways. First, it pinpoints where choices can (have to) be made to obtain a computable algorithm. As a result a wealth of algorithmic solutions can be found. Second, it seeks online the earliest time in the future where a minimization of the criterion can be expected. It thus goes beyond the classical approaches that myopically decide at each time step whether to make a decision or to postpone the call one more time step. After this general setting has been expounded, we study one simple declination of the meta-algorithm, and we show the results obtained on synthetic and real time series data sets chosen for their ability to test the robustness and properties of the technique.

The perfor- mance of these models can vary significantly when they are learned and deployed in different contexts with different data distributions. In the lit- erature, this phenomenon is called dataset shift. In this paper, we address several important issues in the dataset shift problem. First, how can we automatically detect that there is a significant difference between train- ing and deployment data to take action or adjust the model appropri- ately? Secondly, different shifts can occur in real applications (e.g., linear and non-linear), which require the use of diverse solutions. Thirdly, how should we combine the original model of the training data with other models to achieve better performance? This work offers two main contri- butions towards these issues. We propose a Versatile Model that is rich enough to handle different kinds of shift without making strong assump- tions such as linearity, and furthermore does not require labelled data to identify the data shift at deployment. Empirical results on both synthetic shift and real datasets shift show strong performance gains by achieved the proposed model.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;

Such analysis, however, can compromise personal privacy. We propose a visual analytics approach to semantic analysis of mobility data in which traces of a large number of people are processed simultaneously without accessing individual-level data.

Typically, to solve this problem, a constraint for pattern selection is introduced. One of the first constraints proposed in pattern mining is support frequency of a pattern in a dataset. Frequency is an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern selection are not anti-monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate patterns satisfying these constraints. In this paper we introduce the notion of projection-antimonotonicity and $$\vartheta -\sum $$o$$\psi \iota \alpha $$ algorithm that allows efficient generation of the best patterns for some nonmonotonic constraints. In this paper we consider stability and $$\Delta $$-measure, which are nonmonotonic constraints, and apply them to interval tuple datasets.

We propose a new method for community detection, which estimates both per-community feature distributions topics and per-node community membership. Communities are modeled as connected subgraphs with nodes sharing similar attributes. Nodes may join multiple communities and share common attributes with each. Communities have an associated probability distribution over attributes and node attributes are modeled as draws from a mixture distribution. We make two basic assumptions about community structure: communities are densely connected and have a small network diameter. These assumptions inform the estimation of community topics and membership assignments without being too prescriptive.

For each selected model, we further performed MBSD to locate a number of subgroups that the selected model has a deviated prediction performance. Then another set of pretrained models are selected only according to their MAE over the subgroup. Finally, the prediction are made by averaging the prediction from the models selected during the previous two steps.

In this paper, fraudsters are those who participate in their own auction in order to drive up the final price. They tend to frequently bid in auctions hosted by fraudulent sellers, who work in the same collusion group. Our graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for online auction fraud detection is based on this social interaction of fraudsters. Auction users and their transactions are represented as a social interaction graph. Given a small set of known fraudsters, our aim was to detect more fraudsters based on the hypothesis that strong edges between fraudsters frequently exist in online auction social graphs. Detecting fraudsters who work in collusion with known fraudsters was our primary goal. We also found that weighted degree centrality is a distinct feature that separates fraudsters and legitimate users. We actively used this fact to detect fraud. To this end, we extended the modified adsorption model by incorporating the weighted degree centrality of nodes. The results, from real world data, show that by integrating the weighted degree centrality to the model can significantly improve accuracy.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;machine learning;

While some fraudulent use manifests as a small-scale resource consumption, a more serious type of fraud is that of fraud storms, which are events of large-scale fraudulent use. These events begin when fraudulent users discover new vulnerabilities in the sign up process, which they then exploit in mass. The ability to perform early detection of these storms is a critical component of any cloud-based public computing system. In this work we analyze telemetry data from Microsoft Azure to detect fraud storms and raise early alerts on sudden increases in fraudulent use. The use of machine learning approaches to identify such anomalous events involves two inherent challenges: the scarcity of these events, and at the same time, the high frequency of anomalous events in cloud systems. We compare the performance of a supervised approach to the one achieved by an unsupervised, multivariate anomaly detection framework. We further evaluate the system performance taking into account practical considerations of robustness in the presence of missing values, and minimization of the model's data collection period.

For exploratory purposes this is unsatisfactory, as we want to explore the data, not our expectations. In this paper we study how to non-parametrically measure the divergence between two distributions. More in particular, we formalise the well-known Jensen-Shannon divergence using cumulative distribution functions.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized modularity measure called GM which has a more sophisticated interpretation of vertex similarity. In particular, GM also takes into account the number of longer paths between vertices, compared to what would be expected in a randomized network.

Dyad Ranking Using A Bilinear Plackett-Luce Model,Dirk Schäfer (University of Marburg);Eyke Hüllermeier (University of Paderborn);,"2400979147,323026139","Label ranking is a specific type of preference learning problem, namely the problem of learning a model that maps instances to rankings over a finite set of predefined alternatives. These alternatives are identified by their name or label while not being characterized in terms of any properties or features that could be potentially useful for learning. In this paper, we consider a generalization of the label ranking problem that we call dyad ranking. In dyad ranking, not only the instances but also the alternatives are represented in terms of attributes. For learning in the setting of dyad ranking, we propose an extension of an existing label ranking method based on the Plackett-Luce model, a statistical model for rank data. Moreover, we present first experimental results confirming the usefulness of the additional information provided by the feature description of alternatives.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,ranking;ranking svm;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;
Robust Representation for Domain Adaptation in Network Security,"Karel Bartos (Czech Technical University in Prague);Michal Sofka (Cisco Systems, Inc.);","2128455305,1880413372","The goal of domain adaptation is to solve the problem of different joint distribution of observation and labels in the training and testing data sets. This problem happens in many practical situations such as when a malware detector is trained from labeled datasets at certain time point but later evolves to evade detection. We solve the problem by introducing a new representation which ensures that a conditional distribution of the observation given labels is the same. The representation is computed for bags of samples network traffic logs and is designed to be invariant under shifting and scaling of the feature values extracted from the logs and under permutation and size changes of the bags. The invariance of the representation is achieved by relying on a self-similarity matrix computed for each bag. In our experiments, we will show that the representation is effective for training detector of malicious traffic in large corporate networks.

To tackle the task based on store sensors, we develop a method called Potential Customer Estimator PCE, which models the spatial and temporal correlation between existing stores and query locations using geographical, mobility, and features on location-based social networks.

Belief propagation, as a method for performing approximate inference in loopy graphs, has shown empirical success in many applications. However, convergence of belief propagation can only be guaranteed for simple graphs. Whether belief propagation converges depends strongly on the applied message update scheme, and specialized schemes can be highly beneficial. Yet, residual belief propagation is the only established method utilizing this fact to improve convergence properties. In experiments, we observe that residual belief propagation fails to converge if local oscillations occur and the same sequence of messages is repeatedly updated. To overcome this issue, we propose two novel message update schemes. In the first scheme we add noise to oscillating messages. In the second scheme we apply weight decay to gradually reduce the influence of these messages and consequently enforce convergence. Furthermore, in contrast to previous work, we consider the correctness of the obtained marginals and observe significant performance improvements when applying the proposed message update schemes to various Ising models with binary random variables.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,belief propagation;theoretical computer science;discrete mathematics;distributed computing;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

This leads to a sparse structure of the learned dictionary over the a-priori dictionary, and a sparse structure of the data over the learned dictionary. We apply the hierarchical sparse dictionary learning approach on both synthetic data and real-world high-dimensional time series data. The experimental results demonstrate that the hierarchical sparse dictionary learning approach reduces overfitting and enhances the generalizability of the learned dictionary.

Latent Factors Meet Homophily in Diffusion Modelling,Minh-Duc Luu (Singapore Management University);Ee-Peng Lim (Singapore Management University);,"2320616053,2136050841","Diffusion is an important dynamics that helps spreading information within an online social network. While there are already numerous models for single item diffusion, few have studied diffusion of multiple items, especially when items can interact with one another due to their inter-similarity. Moreover, the well-known homophily effect is rarely considered explicitly in the existing diffusion models. This work therefore fills this gap by proposing a novel model called Topic level Interaction Homophily Aware Diffusion TIHAD to include both latent factor level interaction among items and homophily factor in diffusion. The model determines item interaction based on latent factors and edge strengths based on homophily factor in the computation of social influence. An algorithm for training TIHAD model is also proposed. Our experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that: a homophily increases diffusion significantly, and b item interaction at topic level boosts diffusion among similar items.

Furthermore, a two-hidden-layer SCRN of a pair of disjoint pattern sets can be used to decompose one of the pattern sets into several subsets so that each subset is convexly separable from the entire other pattern set; and a single-hidden-layer SCRN of a pair of convexly separable pattern sets can be used to decompose one of the pattern sets into several subsets so that each subset is linearly separable from the entire other pattern set. SCRN can thus be used to learn the pattern structures from the decomposed subsets of patterns and to analyse the discriminant factors of different patterns from the linear classifiers of the linearly separable subsets in the decompositions.

In this paper, we present differentially private queries for counting outliers that appear in a given subspace, instead of reporting the outliers detected. Our analysis of the global sensitivity of outlier counts reveals that regular global sensitivity-based methods can make the outputs too noisy, particularly when the dimensionality of the given subspace is high. Noting that the counts of outliers are typically expected to be small compared to the number of data, we introduce a mechanism based on the smooth upper bound of the local sensitivity.

For example, it is often possible to use various kinds of pre- and post-processing and various base classifiers or regressors as components of the same modular approach. We propose a framework, called Scavenger, that allows evaluating whole families of conceptually similar algorithms efficiently. The algorithms are represented as compositions, couplings and products of atomic subalgorithms. This allows partial results to be cached and shared between different instances of a modular algorithm, so that potentially expensive partial results need not be recomputed multiple times. Furthermore, our framework deals with issues of the parallel execution, load balancing, and with the backup of partial results for the case of implementation or runtime errors.

Multidimensional Prediction Models When the Resolution Context Changes,Adolfo Martínez-Usó (Polytechnic University of Valencia);José Hernández-Orallo (Polytechnic University of Valencia);,"221371695,309815489","Multidimensional data is systematically analysed at multiple granularities by applying aggregate and disaggregate operators e.g., by the use of OLAP tools. For instance, in a supermarket we may want to predict sales of tomatoes for next week, but we may also be interested in predicting sales for all vegetables higher up in the product hierarchy for next Friday lower down in the time dimension. While the domain and data are the same, the operating context is different. We explore several approaches for multidimensional data when predictions have to be made at different levels or contexts of aggregation. One method relies on the same resolution, another approach aggregates predictions bottom-up, a third approach disaggregates predictions top-down and a final technique corrects predictions using the relation between levels. We show how these strategies behave when the resolution context changes, using several machine learning techniques in four application domains.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data science;data mining;database;computer science;
A Practical Approach to Reduce the Learning Bias Under Covariate Shift,Van-Tinh Tran (University of Lyon);Alex Aussem (University of Lyon);,"2475817864,1210402752","Covariate shift is a specific class of selection bias that arises when the marginal distributions of the input features X are different in the source and the target domains while the conditional distributions of the target Y given X are the same. A common technique to deal with this problem, called importance weighting, amounts to reweighting the training instances in order to make them resemble the test distribution. However this usually comes at the expense of a reduction of the effective sample size. In this paper, we show analytically that, while the unweighted model is globally more biased than the weighted one, it may locally be less biased on low importance instances. In view of this result, we then discuss a manner to optimally combine the weighted and the unweighted models in order to improve the predictive performance in the target domain. We conduct a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the efficiency of this approach.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,econometrics;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;
Temporally Coherent Role-Topic Models TCRTM: Deinterlacing Overlapping Activity Patterns,Evgeniy Bart (PARC);Bob Price (PARC);John Hanley (PARC);,"2182634394,2646703982,2109103318","The Temporally Coherent Role-Topic Model TCRTM is a probabilistic graphical model for analyzing overlapping, loosely temporally structured activities in heterogeneous populations. Such structure appears in many domains where activities have temporal coherence, but no strong ordering. For instance, editing a PowerPoint presentation may involve opening files, typing text, and downloading images. These events occur together in time, but without fixed ordering or duration. Further, several different activities may overlap --- the user might check email while editing the presentation. Finally, the user population has subgroups; for example, managers, salespeople and engineers have different activity distributions. TCRTM automatically infers an appropriate set of roles and activity types, and segments users' event streams into high-level activity instance descriptions. On two real-world datasets involving computer user monitoring and debit card transactions we show that TCRTM extracts semantically meaningful structure and improves hold-out perplexity score by a factor of five compared to standard models.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,multimedia;world wide web;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Weighted Rank Correlation: A Flexible Approach Based on Fuzzy Order Relations,Sascha Henzgen (University of Paderborn);Eyke Hüllermeier (University of Paderborn);,"2616966722,323026139","Measures of rank correlation are commonly used in statistics to capture the degree of concordance between two orderings of the same set of items. Standard measures like Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho coefficient put equal emphasis on each position of a ranking. Yet, motivated by applications in which some of the positions typically those on the top are more important than others, a few weighted variants of these measures have been proposed. Most of these generalizations fail to meet desirable formal properties, however. Besides, they are often quite inflexible in the sense of committing to a fixed weighing scheme. In this paper, we propose a weighted rank correlation measure on the basis of fuzzy order relations. Our measure, called scaled gamma, is related to Goodman and Kruskal's gamma rank correlation. It is parametrized by a fuzzy equivalence relation on the rank positions, which in turn is specified conveniently by a so-called scaling function. This approach combines soundness with flexibility: it has a sound formal foundation and allows for weighing rank positions in a flexible way. The usefulness of our class of weighted rank correlation measures is shown by means of experimental studies using both synthetic and real-world ranking data.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,ordinal association;rank reversals in decision making;rank correlation;combinatorics;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

Sparse Bayesian Recurrent Neural Networks,Sotirios P. Chatzis (Cyprus University of Technology);,2328971761,"Recurrent neural networks RNNs have recently gained renewed attention from the machine learning community as effective methods for modeling variable-length sequences. Language modeling, handwriting recognition, and speech recognition are only few of the application domains where RNN-based models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance currently reported in the literature. Typically, RNN architectures utilize simple linear, logistic, or softmax output layers to perform data modeling and prediction generation. In this work, for the first time in the literature, we consider using a sparse Bayesian regression or classification model as the output layer of RNNs, inspired from the automatic relevance determination ARD technique. The notion of ARD is to continually create new components while detecting when a component starts to overfit, where overfit manifests itself as a precision hyperparameter posterior tending to infinity. This way, our method manages to train sparse RNN models, where the number of effective ""active"" recurrently connected hidden units is selected in a data-driven fashion, as part of the model inference procedure. We develop efficient and scalable training algorithms for our model under the stochastic variational inference paradigm, and derive elegant predictive density expressions with computational costs comparable to conventional RNN formulations. We evaluate our approach considering its application to challenging tasks dealing with both regression and classification problems, and exhibit its favorable performance over the state-of-the-art.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature selection method seeking a feature coefficient matrix to select the most distinctive features. Specifically, our proposed algorithm integrates the Maximum Margin Criterion with a sparsity-based model into a joint framework, where the class margin and feature correlation are taken into account at the same time. To maximize the total data separability while preserving minimized within-class scatter simultaneously, we propose to embed Kmeans into the framework generating pseudo class label information in a scenario of unsupervised feature selection. Meanwhile, a sparsity-based model, ` 2 ,p-norm, is imposed to the regularization term to effectively discover the sparse structures of the feature coefficient matrix. In this way, noisy and irrelevant features are removed by ruling out those features whose corresponding coefficients are zeros. To alleviate the local optimum problem that is caused by random initializations of K-means, a convergence guaranteed algorithm with an updating strategy for the clustering indicator matrix, is proposed to iteractively chase the optimal solution. Performance evaluation is extensively conducted over six benchmark data sets. From plenty of experimental results, it is demonstrated that our method has superior performance against all other compared approaches.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,feature;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;mathematics;

"Multiple Incomplete Views Clustering via Weighted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with L 2,1 Regularization",Weixiang Shao (University of Illinois at Chicago);Lifang He (Shenzhen University);Philip S. Yu (University of Illinois at Chicago);,"2151340973,2555188826,2125104194","With the advance of technology, data are often with mul- tiple modalities or coming from multiple sources. Multi-view clustering provides a natural way for generating clusters from such data. Although multi-view clustering has been successfully applied in many applications, most of the previous methods assumed the completeness of each view (i.e., each instance appears in all views). However, in real-world appli- cations, it is often the case that a number of views are available for learning but none of them is complete. The incompleteness of all the views and the number of available views make it difficult to integrate all the incomplete views and get a better clustering solution. In this paper, we propose MIC (Multi-Incomplete-view Clustering), an algorithm based on weighted nonnegative matrix factorization with L2,1 regularization. The proposed MIC works by learning the latent feature matrices for all the views and generating a consensus matrix so that the difference between each view and the consensus is minimized. MIC has several advantages comparing with other existing methods. First, MIC incorpo- rates weighted nonnegative matrix factorization, which handles the miss- ing instances in each incomplete view. Second, MIC uses a co-regularized approach, which pushes the learned latent feature matrices of all the views towards a common consensus. By regularizing the disagreement between the latent feature matrices and the consensus, MIC can be easily extended to more than two incomplete views. Third, MIC incorporates L2,1 regularization into the weighted nonnegative matrix factorization, which makes it robust to noises and outliers. Forth, an iterative optimiza- tion framework is used in MIC, which is scalable and proved to converge.

Subjectively interesting alternative clusterings,Kleanthis-Nikolaos Kontonasios (University of Bristol);Tijl De Bie (University of Bristol);,"1996008567,2080198120","We deploy a recently proposed framework for mining subjectively interesting patterns from data to the problem of alternative clustering, where patterns are sets of clusters (clusterings) in the data. This framework outlines how subjective interestingness of patterns (here, clusterings) can be quantified using sound information theoretic concepts. We demonstrate how it motivates a new objective function quantifying the interestingness of a clustering, automatically accounting for a user's prior beliefs and for redundancies between the discovered patterns. Directly searching for the optimal set of clusterings defined in this way is hard. However, the optimization problem can be solved approximately if clusterings are generated iteratively. In this iterative scheme, each subsequent clustering is maximally interesting given the whole set of previously generated clusterings, automatically trading off interestingness with non-redundancy. Although generating each clustering in an iterative fashion is computationally hard as well, we develop an approximation technique similar to spectral clustering algorithms. Our method can generate as many clusterings as the user requires. Subjective evaluation or the value of the objective function can guide the termination of the process. In addition our method allows varying the number of clusters in each successive clustering. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that the mined clusterings fulfill the requirements of a good clustering solution by being both non-redundant and of high compactness. Comparison with existing solutions shows that our approach compares favourably with regard to well-known objective measures of similarity and quality of clusterings, even though it is not designed to directly optimize them.",2015,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,knowledge extraction;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

This could become a serious issue as one considers deeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of non-linearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually discrete. Inspired by the biological implausibility of back-propagation, a few approaches have been proposed in the past that could play a similar credit assignment role. In this spirit, we explore a novel approach to credit assignment in deep networks that we call target propagation. The main idea is to compute targets rather than gradients, at each layer. Like gradients, they are propagated backwards. In a way that is related but different from previously proposed proxies for back-propagation which rely on a backwards network with symmetric weights, target propagation relies on auto-encoders at each layer. Unlike back-propagation, it can be applied even when units exchange stochastic bits rather than real numbers. We show that a linear correction for the imperfectness of the auto-encoders, called difference target propagation, is very effective to make target propagation actually work, leading to results comparable to back-propagation for deep networks with discrete and continuous units and denoising auto-encoders and achieving state of the art for stochastic networks.",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Regression with Linear Factored Functions,Wendelin Böhmer (Technical University of Berlin);Klaus Obermayer (Technical University of Berlin);,"2100221316,2690753462","Many applications that use empirically estimated functions face a curse of dimensionality, because integrals over most function classes must be approximated by sampling. This paper introduces a novel regression- algorithm that learns linear factored functions (LFF). This class of functions has structural properties that allow to analytically solve certain integrals and to calculate point-wise products. Applications like belief propagation and re- inforcement learning can exploit these properties to break the curse and speed up computation. We derive a regularized greedy optimization scheme, that learns factored basis functions during training. The novel regression al- gorithm performs competitively to Gaussian processes on benchmark tasks, and the learned LFF functions are with 4-9 factored basis functions on av- erage very compact.",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,machine learning;mathematical optimization;statistics;algorithm;mathematics;
Linear State-Space Model with Time-Varying Dynamics,Jaakko Luttinen (Aalto University);Tapani Raiko (Aalto University);Alexander Ilin (Aalto University);,"2058785924,344142627,2707214179","This paper introduces a linear state-space model with time- varying dynamics. The time dependency is obtained by forming the state dynamics matrix as a time-varying linear combination of a set of ma- trices. The time dependency of the weights in the linear combination is modelled by another linear Gaussian dynamical model allowing the model to learn how the dynamics of the process changes. Previous ap- proaches have used switching models which have a small set of possible state dynamics matrices and the model selects one of those matrices at each time, thus jumping between them. Our model forms the dynamics as a linear combination and the changes can be smooth and more contin- uous. The model is motivated by physical processes which are described by linear partial differential equations whose parameters vary in time. An example of such a process could be a temperature field whose evo- lution is driven by a varying wind direction. The posterior inference is performed using variational Bayesian approximation. The experiments on stochastic advection-diffusion processes and real-world weather pro- cesses show that the model with time-varying dynamics can outperform previously introduced approaches.",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,log linear model;linear model;econometrics;simulation;mathematical optimization;mathematics;

Flexibilities can be expressed as flex- offers, which due to their high number need to be aggregated to reduce the complexity of energy scheduling.

Promising progress has recently been achieved by methods that learn to map questions to logical forms or database queries. Such approaches can be effective but at the cost of either large amounts of human-labeled data or by defining lexicons and grammars tailored by practitioners. In this paper, we instead take the radical approach of learning to map questions to vectorial feature representations. By mapping answers into the same space one can query any knowledge base independent of its schema, without requiring any grammar or lexicon. Our method is trained with a new optimization procedure combining stochastic gradient descent followed by a fine-tuning step using the weak supervision provided by blending automatically and collaboratively generated resources.

Knowledge-Powered Deep Learning for Word Embedding,Jiang Bian (Microsoft);Bin Gao (Microsoft);Tie-Yan Liu (Microsoft);,"2609123459,2616890138,2108341226","The basis of applying deep learning to solve natural language processing tasks is to obtain high-quality distributed representations of words, i.e., word embeddings, from large amounts of text data. However, text itself usually contains incomplete and ambiguous information, which makes necessity to leverage extra knowledge to understand it. Fortunately, text itself already contains well-defined morphological and syntactic knowledge; moreover, the large amount of texts on the Web enable the extraction of plenty of semantic knowledge. Therefore, it makes sense to design novel deep learning algorithms and systems in order to leverage the above knowledge to compute more effective word embeddings. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on the capacity of leveraging morphological, syntactic, and semantic knowledge to achieve high-quality word embeddings. Our study explores these types of knowledge to define new basis for word representation, provide additional input information, and serve as auxiliary supervision in deep learning, respectively.

The proposed L p unit receives signals from several projections of a subset of units in the layer below and computes a normalized L p norm. We notice two interesting interpretations of the L p unit. First, the proposed unit can be understood as a generalization of a number of conventional pooling operators such as average, root-mean-square and max pooling widely used in, for instance, convolutional neural networks (CNN), HMAX models and neocognitrons. Furthermore, the L p unit is, to a certain degree, similar to the recently proposed maxout unit [13] which achieved the state-of-the-art object recognition results on a number of benchmark datasets. Secondly, we provide a geometrical interpretation of the activation function based on which we argue that the L p unit is more efficient at representing complex, nonlinear separating boundaries. Each L p unit defines a superelliptic boundary, with its exact shape defined by the order p. We claim that this makes it possible to model arbitrarily shaped, curved boundaries more efficiently by combining a few L p units of different orders. This insight justifies the need for learning different orders for each unit in the model. We empirically evaluate the proposed L p units on a number of datasets and show that multilayer perceptrons (MLP) consisting of the L p units achieve the state-of-the-art results on a number of benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed L p unit on the recently proposed deep recurrent neural networks (RNN).",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,multilayer perceptron;deep learning;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;

Optimal Thresholding of Classifiers to Maximize F1 Measure,"Zachary C.

The harmonic mean of precision and recall, the F1 measure is widely used to evaluate the success of a binary classifier when one class is rare. Micro average, macro average, and per instance average F1 measures are used in multilabel classification. For any classifier that produces a real-valued output, we derive the relationship between the best achievable F1 value and the decision-making threshold that achieves this optimum. As a special case, if the classifier outputs are well-calibrated conditional probabilities, then the optimal threshold is half the optimal F1 value. As another special case, if the classifier is completely uninformative, then the optimal behavior is to classify all examples as positive. When the actual prevalence of positive examples is low, this behavior can be undesirable.

Despite the diversity of topic modeling algorithms that have been proposed, a common challenge in successfully applying these techniques is the selection of an appropriate number of topics for a given corpus. Choosing too few topics will produce results that are overly broad, while choosing too many will result in the""over-clustering"" of a corpus into many small, highly-similar topics. In this paper, we propose a term-centric stability analysis strategy to address this issue, the idea being that a model with an appropriate number of topics will be more robust to perturbations in the data.

However, this potential is mostly unused in real-world problems because of two main limitations: first, current approaches can typically only be applied to learn open-loop controllers and second, current sampling procedures are inefficient and not scalable to high dimensional systems. We introduce the efficient Path Integral Relative-Entropy Policy Search (PI-REPS) algorithm for learning feedback policies with PI control. Our algorithm is inspired by information theoretic policy updates that are often used in policy search. We use these updates to approximate the state trajectory distribution that is known to be optimal from the PI control theory. Our approach allows for a principled treatment of different sampling distributions and can be used to estimate many types of parametric or non-parametric feedback controllers. We show that PI-REPS significantly outperforms current methods and is able to solve tasks that are out of reach for current methods.",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,path integral formulation;theoretical computer science;control theory;data mining;machine learning;mathematical optimization;mathematics;
Semi-supervised learning using an unsupervised atlas,Nikolaos Pitelis (University College London);Chris Russell (University College London);Lourdes Agapito (University College London);,"2570014473,2240097882,2337824086","In many machine learning problems, high-dimensional datasets often lie on or near manifolds of locally low-rank. This knowledge can be exploited to avoid the ""curse of dimensionality"" when learning a classifier. Explicit manifold learning formulations such as lle are rarely used for this purpose, and instead classifiers may make use of methods such as local co-ordinate coding or auto-encoders to implicitly characterise the manifold. We propose novel manifold-based kernels for semi-supervised and supervised learning. We show how smooth classifiers can be learnt from existing descriptions of manifolds that characterise the manifold as a set of piecewise affine charts, or an atlas. We experimentally validate the importance of this smoothness vs. the more natural piecewise smooth classifiers, and we show a significant improvement over competing methods on standard datasets. In the semi-supervised learning setting our experiments show how using unlabelled data to learn the detailed shape of the underlying manifold substantially improves the accuracy of a classifier trained on limited labelled data. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,semi supervised learning;data science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

While margin-based strategies have been dominant for Support Vector Machines (SVMs), most methods are based on heuristics and lack a solid theoretical support. In this paper, we propose an active learning strategy for SVMs based on Maximum Model Change (MMC). The model change is defined as the difference between the current model parameters and the updated parameters obtained with the enlarged training set. Inspired by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) update rule, we measure the change as the gradient of the loss at a candidate point. We analyze the convergence property of the proposed method, and show that the upper bound of label requests made by MMC is smaller than passive learning. Moreover, we connect the proposed MMC algorithm with the widely used simple margin method in order to provide a theoretical justification for margin-based strategies.

Clustering vertices in such networks, and analyzing the complex interactions between clusters of different types, can provide useful insights into the structure of the data. To exploit the full information content of the data, clustering approaches should consider the connections in the network as well as the vertex attributes. We propose the density-based clustering model TCSC for the detection of clusters in heterogeneous networks that are densely connected in the network as well as in the attribute space.

Importance Weighted Inductive Transfer Learning for Regression,Jochen Garcke (Technical University of Berlin);Thomas Vanck;,"260868480,98649779","We consider inductive transfer learning for dataset shift, a situation in which the distributions of two sampled, but closely related, datasets differ. When the target data to be predicted is scarce, one would like to improve its prediction by employing data from the other, secondary, dataset. Transfer learning tries to address this task by suitably compensating such a dataset shift. In this work we assume that the distributions of the covariates and the dependent variables can differ arbitrarily between the datasets. We propose two methods for regression based on importance weighting. Here to each instance of the secondary data a weight is assigned such that the data contributes positively to the prediction of the target data.

Most existing methods are focused on learning weights for different domains based on the similarities between each source do- main and the target domain or learning more precise classifiers from the source domain data jointly by maximizing their consensus of predictions on the target domain data. However, these methods only consider measuring similarities or building classifiers on the original data space, and fail to discover a more power- ful feature representation of the data when transferring knowledge from multiple source domains to the target domain. In this paper, we propose a new framework for transfer learning with multiple source domains. Specifically, in the proposed framework, we adopt autoencoders to construct a feature mapping from an orig- inal instance to a hidden representation, and train multiple classifiers from the source domain data jointly by performing an entropy-based consensus regular- izer on the predictions on the target domain. Based on the framework, a particular solution is proposed to learn the hidden representation and classifiers simultane- ously.

An established measure of vertex-proximity in graphs is the Personalized Page Rank (ppr) score based on random walk with restarts. Since ppr scores have long-range correlations, computing them accurately and efficiently is challenging when the graph is too large to fit in main memory, especially when it also changes over time. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm to answer ppr-based k-nn queries in large time-evolving graphs. Our key approach is to use a divide-and-conquer framework and efficiently compute answers in a distributed fashion. We represent a given graph as a collection of dense vertex-clusters with their inter connections. Each vertex-cluster maintains certain information related to internal random walks and updates this information as the graph changes. At query time, we combine this information from a small set of relevant clusters and compute ppr scores efficiently.

Specifically, a small fraction of the training data is randomly sampled to learn the PCA directions each time and only the top eigenvectors are kept to generate one piece of short code. This process is repeated several times and the obtained short codes are concatenated into one piece of long code. By considering each piece of short code as a “super-bit”, the whole process is closely connected with the core idea of LSH.

The FDR method guarantees that all variables selected have statistically significant predictive power.

As side data, the experiments use time series from Google Trends of the volumes of search queries. In total, there are 39,059 potential correlated time series.

This addresses two major limitations in existing semi-supervised learning methods: they can incorporate only one type of domain knowledge (e.g. document labels or feature labels), and they assume that provided labels cover all the classes in the problem space. This limits their applicability in real-life situations where domain knowledge for labeling comes in different forms from different groups of domain experts and some classes may not have labels. hLLDA resolves both the label heterogeneity and label partialness problems in a unified generative process. hLLDA can leverage different forms of supervision and discover semantically coherent topics by exploiting domain knowledge mutually reinforced by different types of labels. Experiments with three document collectionsReuters, 20 Newsgroup and Delicious validate that our model generates a better set of topics and efficiently discover additional latent topics not covered by the labels resulting in better classification and clustering accuracy than existing supervised or semi-supervised topic models.

As the estimates or predictions for such models are usually computationally harder to obtain than for precise ones, we study the extension of two binary decomposition strategies that remain easy to obtain and computationally efficient to manipulate when shifting from precise to bounded estimates. We demonstrate the possible usefulness of such a cautious attitude on tests performed on benchmark data sets.",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,ordinal regression;ordinal data;econometrics;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

This formalism provides a general model for decision-making under uncertainty in cooperative, decentralized settings, but the worst-case complexity makes it difficult to solve optimally (NEXP-complete). Recent advances suggest recasting Dec-POMDPs into continuous-state and deterministic MDPs. In this form, however, states and actions are embedded into high-dimensional spaces, making accurate estimate of states and greedy selection of actions intractable for all but trivial-sized problems. The primary contribution of this paper is the first framework for error-monitoring during approximate estimation of states and selection of actions.

Data is generated in many flavors and follows particularities of the omics perspective adopted along experimental studies.

The dynamic view is brought from the transcriptomics perspective, so the gene expression and its regulation. Finally, interactomics is usually associated to gene products, proteins, and their interactions. However it could also be seen as a huge graph network with layers of interaction integrating distinct omics perspectives. Omics science applications of unsupervised and/or supervised machine learning (ML) techniques abound in the literature.

Conventionally, kPCA relies on Euclidean statistics in kernel feature space. However, Euclidean analysis can make kPCA inefficient or incorrect for many popular kernels that map input points to a hypersphere in kernel feature space. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel adaptation of kPCA, namely kernel principal geodesic analysis (kPGA), for hyperspherical statistical analysis in kernel feature space. This paper proposes tools for statistical analyses on the Riemannian manifold of the Hilbert sphere in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, including algorithms for computing the sample weighted Karcher mean and eigen analysis of the sample weighted Karcher covariance.

Towards Automatic Feature Construction for Supervised Classification,Marc Boullé (Orange S.A.);,743486302,"We suggest an approach to automate variable construction for supervised learning, especially in the multi-relational setting. Domain knowledge is specified by describing the structure of data by the means of variables, tables and links across tables, and choosing construction rules.

We introduce a prior distribution over all the constructed variables, as well as an effective algorithm to draw samples of constructed variables from this distribution.

Pushing-Down Tensor Decompositions over Unions to Promote Reuse of Materialized Decompositions,Mijung Kim (Arizona State University);K. Selçuk Candan (Arizona State University);,"2129489018,674992784","From data collection to decision making, the life cycle of data often involves many steps of integration, manipulation, and analysis. To be able to provide end-to-end support for the full data life cycle, today's data management and decision making systems increasingly combine operations for data manipulation, integration as well as data analysis. Tensor-relational model (TRM) is a framework proposed to support both relational algebraic operations (for data manipulation and integration) and tensor algebraic operations (for data analysis). In this paper, we consider joint processing of relational algebraic and tensor analysis operations. In particular, we focus on data processing workflows that involve data integration from multiple sources (through unions) and tensor decomposition tasks. While, in traditional relational algebra, the costliest operation is known to be the join, in a framework that provides both relational and tensor operations, tensor decomposition tends to be the computationally costliest operation. Therefore, it is most critical to reduce the cost of the tensor decomposition task by manipulating the data processing workflow in a way that reduces the cost of the tensor decomposition step. Therefore, in this paper, we consider data processing workflows involving tensor decomposition and union operations and we propose a novel scheme for pushing down the tensor decompositions over the union operations to reduce the overall data processing times and to promote reuse of materialized tensor decomposition results. Experimental results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,theoretical computer science;data mining;database;computer science;

In RLED, the goal is to find an optimal policy of a Markov Decision Process (MDP), using a data set of fixed sampled transitions of the MDP as well as a data set of fixed expert demonstrations. This is slightly different from the batch Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework where only fixed sampled transitions of the MDP are available. Thus, the aim of this article is to propose algorithms that leverage those expert data. The idea proposed here differs from the Approximate Dynamic Programming methods in the sense that we minimize the Optimal Bellman Residual (OBR), where the minimization is guided by constraints defined by the expert demonstrations. This choice is motivated by the the fact that controlling the OBR implies controlling the distance between the estimated and optimal quality functions. However, this method presents some difficulties as the criterion to minimize is non-convex, non-differentiable and biased. Those difficulties are overcome via the embedding of distributions in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and a boosting technique which allows obtaining non-parametric algorithms.

The representation space is obtained through a constraint-driven linear transformation of a spectral embedding of the data. Constraints are expressed with a Gaussian function that locally reweights the similarities in the projected space. A global, non-convex optimization objective is then derived and the model is learned via gradient descent techniques. Our algorithm is evaluated on standard datasets and compared with state of the art algorithms, like [14,18,31].

Specifically, we assume the feature space ℝ d is known and the kernel machine has m support vectors such that d > m (or d > > m), and in addition, the classifier C is laconic in the sense that for a feature vector, it only provides a predicted label (a±1) without divulging other information such as margin or confidence level. We formulate the problem of understanding the inner working of C as characterizing the decision boundary of the classifier, and we introduce the simple notion of bracketing to sample points on the decision boundary within a prescribed accuracy. For the five most common types of kernel function, linear, quadratic and cubic polynomial kernels, hyperbolic tangent kernel and Gaussian kernel, we show that with O(dm) number of queries, the type of kernel function and the (kernel) subspace spanned by the support vectors can be determined. In particular, for polynomial kernels, additional O(m 3) queries are sufficient to reconstruct the entire decision boundary, providing a set of quasi-support vectors that can be used to efficiently evaluate the deconstructed classifier.

We show that the consistency of a given loss depends on the mixing matrix, which is the transition matrix relating the weak labels and the true class. A linear transformation can be used to convert a conventional classification-calibrated (CC) loss into a weak CC loss. By comparing the maximal dimension of the set of mixing matrices that are admissible for a given CC loss with that for proper losses, we show that classification calibration is a much less restrictive condition than properness. Moreover, we show that while the transformation of conventional proper losses into a weak proper losses does not preserve convexity in general, conventional convex CC losses can be easily transformed into weak and convex CC losses. Our analysis provides a general procedure to construct convex CC losses, and to identify the set of mixing matrices admissible for a given transformation.

However, contamination on shards, which sometimes arises in real world environments, largely deteriorates the performances of the distributed training. To remedy the negative effect of the contamination, we propose a divergence minimization principle for the weight determination in IPM. From this principle, we can naturally derive the Beta-IPM scheme, which leverages the power of robust estimation based on the beta diver- gence. A mistake/loss bound analysis indicates the advantage of our Beta-IPM in contaminated environments.

In this work, we introduce a novel empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework for supervised learning, neutralized ERM (NERM) that ensures that any classifiers obtained can be guaranteed to be neutral with respect to a viewpoint hypothesis. More specifically, given a viewpoint hypothesis, NERM works to find a target hypothesis that minimizes the empirical risk while simultaneously identifying a target hypothesis that is neutral to the viewpoint hypothesis. Within the NERM framework, we derive a theoretical bound on empirical and generalization neutrality risks.

Cross-validation (CV) is a widely accepted kernel selection method. However, the CV based estimates generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are there- fore prone to over-fitting. In order to prevent the high variance, we first propose a novel version of stability, called kernel stability. This stabil- ity quantifies the perturbation of the kernel matrix with respect to the changes in the training set. Then we establish the connection between the kernel stability and variance of CV. By restricting the derived upper bound of the variance, we present a kernel selection criterion, which can prevent the high variance of CV and hence guarantee good generaliza- tion performance.

Hypernode graphs model binary relations between sets of individuals while allowing to reason at the level of individuals. We present a spectral theory for hypernode graphs that allows us to introduce an unnormalized Laplacian and a smoothness semi-norm. In this framework, we are able to extend existing spec-tral graph learning algorithms to the case of hypernode graphs. We show that hypernode graphs are a proper extension of graphs from the expressive power point of view and from the spectral analysis point of view. Therefore hypernode graphs allow to model higher or-der relations while it has been shown in [1] that it is not the case for (classical) hypergraphs. In order to prove the capabilities of the model, we represent mul-tiple players games with hypernode graphs and intro-duce a novel method to infer skill ratings from the game outcomes.

Approximate kernel selection is an emerging approach to alleviating the computational burdens of kernel selection by introducing kernel matrix approximation. Theoretical problems faced by approximate kernel selection are how kernel matrix approximation impacts kernel selection and whether this impact can be ignored for large enough examples. In this paper, we introduce the notion of approximate consistency for kernel matrix approximation algorithm to tackle the theoretical problems and establish the preliminary foundations of approximate kernel selection. By analyzing the approximate consistency of kernel matrix approximation algorithms, we can answer the question that, under what conditions, and how, the approximate kernel selection criterion converges to the accurate one. Taking two kernel selection criteria as examples, we analyze the approximate consistency of Nystrom approximation and multilevel circulant matrix approximation.

Therefore, an adaptive approach is required that can manage concept drift in an online fashion. This paper presents a probabilistic non-parametric generative model for stream classification that can handle concept drift efficiently and adjust its complexity over time. Unlike recent methods, the proposed model handles concept drift by adapting data-concept association without unnecessary i.i.d. assumption among the data of a batch. This allows the model to efficiently classify data using fewer and simpler base classifiers. Moreover, an online algorithm for making inference on the proposed non-conjugate time-dependent non-parametric model is proposed.

Current generation of genomic technologies have allowed researchers to determine the collective DNA sequence of all microorganisms co-existing together. In this paper, we present some of the challenges related to the analysis of data ob- tained from the community genomics experiment (commonly referred by metagenomics), advocate the need of machine learning techniques and highlight our contributions related to development of supervised and un- supervised techniques for solving this complex, real world problem. 1 Background Advances in genome-sequencing have transformed the manner of characterizing large populations of microbial communities, that are ubiquitous across several environments. The process of ""metagenomics"" involves sequencing of the genetic material of all organisms co-existing within ecosystems ranging from ocean, soil and the human body. (can be referred to as community genomics). Orthogonally, proteomics and mass spectrometry allow the study of bio-transformations due to these microbial communities in the form of metaproteomes and metabolomes, respectively. Several researchers and clinicians have embarked on studying the pathogenic role played by the microbiome (i.e., the collection of microbial or- ganisms within the human body) with respect to human health and disease conditions. In a similar effort, other groups of researchers are using the metage- nomics technology to characterize different ecological environments across the planet (also referred by ""Earth Microbiome""). Annotating microbial sequences (reads or quasi-assembled contigs) within a sample is a challenging task due to the unknown, diverse and complex nature of microbial communities within the different environments. There is a critical need to develop mining methods that can characterize metagenome data in terms of taxonomy, function and metabolic potential, and correlate the multi-modal, microbial data to clinical or environmental metadata. We present our ongoing efforts that have lead to the development of novel supervised learning approaches and scalable clustering methods to solve these real world challenges.",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,metagenomics an alternative approach to genomics;bioinformatics;data mining;

Items are also associated with corresponding latent-factor vector representations. The probabilistic factorization of the rating data and trust relationships is exploited to infer user susceptibility and expertise. Statistical social-network modeling is instead used to constrain the trust relationships from a user to another to be governed by their respective susceptibility and expertise. The inherently ambiguous meaning of unobserved trust relationships between users is suitably disambiguated.

Indeed, the eigenfunction expansion of a Gram matrix is dependent on the input data density f 0. The resulting statistical test is shown to be uniformly most powerful for a given false alarm level α when the alternative density is uniform over the support of the null distribution.

Local Policy Search in a Convex Space and Conservative Policy Iteration as Boosted Policy Search,Bruno Scherrer (University of Lorraine);Matthieu Geist (Supélec);,"1735999048,2167327128","Local Policy Search is a popular reinforcement learning approach for handling large state spaces. Formally, it searches locally in a parameterized policy space in order to maximize the associated value function averaged over some pre-defined distribution. The best one can hope in general from such an approach is to get a local optimum of this criterion. The first contribution of this article is the following surprising result: if the policy space is convex, any (approximate) local optimum enjoys a global performance guarantee. Unfortunately, the convexity assumption is strong: it is not satisfied by commonly used parameterizations and designing a parameterization that induces this property seems hard. A natural so-lution to alleviate this issue consists in deriving an algorithm that solves the local policy search problem using a boosting approach (constrained to the convex hull of the policy space). The resulting algorithm turns out to be a slight generalization of conservative policy iteration; thus, our second contribution is to highlight an original connection between local policy search and approximate dynamic pro-gramming.",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,mathematical economics;combinatorics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;

One issue associated with NADEs is that they rely on a particular order of factorization for P (x). This issue has been recently addressed by a variant of NADE called Order- less NADEs and its deeper version, Deep Orderless NADE. Orderless NADEs are trained based on a criterion that stochastically maximizes P (x) with all possible orders of factorizations. Unfortunately, ancestral sampling from deep NADE is very expensive, corresponding to running through a neural net separately predicting each of the visible variables given some others. This work makes a connection between this criterion and the training criterion for Generative Stochastic Networks (GSNs). It shows that training NADEs in this way also trains a GSN, which de- fines a Markov chain associated with the NADE model. Based on this connection, we show an alternative way to sample from a trained Order- less NADE that allows to trade-off computing time and quality of the samples: a 3 to 10-fold speedup (taking into account the waste due to correlations between consecutive samples of the chain) can be obtained without noticeably reducing the quality of the samples. This is achieved using a novel sampling procedure for GSNs called annealed GSN sam- pling, similar to tempering methods that combines fast mixing (obtained thanks to steps at high noise levels) with accurate samples (obtained thanks to steps at low noise levels).",2014,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

However, a more general framework, referred to as Conic MTL, can be formulated by considering conic combinations of the objective functions instead; in this framework, Average MTL arises as a special case, when all combi- nation coefficients equal 1. Although the advantage of Conic MTL over Average MTL has been shown experimentally in previous works, no the- oretical justification has been provided to date. In this paper, we derive a generalization bound for the Conic MTL method, and demonstrate that the tightest bound is not necessarily achieved, when all combination co- efficients equal 1; hence, Average MTL may not always be the optimal choice, and it is important to consider Conic MTL. As a byproduct of the generalization bound, it also theoretically explains the good exper- imental results of previous relevant works. Finally, we propose a new Conic MTL model, whose conic combination coefficients minimize the generalization bound, instead of choosing them heuristically as has been done in previous methods.

Since it does not require to fix the number of clusters in advance, the mean shift has been a popular clustering algorithm in various application fields. A typical implementation of the mean shift is to first estimate the density by kernel density estimation and then compute its gradient. However, since good density estimation does not necessarily imply accurate estimation of the density gradient, such an indirect two-step approach is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a method to directly estimate the gradient of the log-density without going through density estimation. The proposed method gives the global solution analytically and thus is computationally efficient. We then develop a mean-shift-like fixed-point algorithm to find the modes of the density for clustering. As in the mean shift, one does not need to set the number of clusters in advance.

These days, cross-validation is the most widely used method for this task. There are, however, a number of important points that should be taken into account when using this methodology. First, one should clearly state what they are trying to estimate. Namely, a distinction should be made between the evaluation of a model learned on a single dataset, and that of a learner trained on a random sample from a given data population. Each of these two questions requires a dierent statistical approach and should not be confused with each other.

GWAS data are often combined with known biological networks, and they have been analyzed using graphmining techniques toward a systems understanding of the biological changes caused by the SNPs. To determine which subgraphs are associated with the disease, a statistical test on each subgraph needs to be conducted. However, no statistically signicant results were found because multiple testing correction causes an extremely small corrected signicance level. We introduce a method called gLAMP to enumerate subgraphs having statistically signicant associations with a diagnosis. gLAMP integrates the Limitless Arity Multipletesting Procedure (LAMP) with a graph-mining algorithm called COmmon Itemset Network mining (COIN). LAMP gives us the smallest possible Bonferroni factor, and COIN provides us with ecient enumeration of testable subgraphs.

Then, we model an author as the result of clustering the relational descriptions associated to the sentences. The underlying idea is that such a model can express the typ- ical way in which an author composes the sentences in his writings. So, if we can map such writing habits from the unknown-author model to the known-author model, we can conclude that the author is the same.

Recently, several recommendation models have been proposed to transfer knowledge by pooling together the rating data from multiple domains to alleviate the sparsity problem, which typically assume that multiple domains share a latent common rating pattern based on the user-item co-clustering. In practice, however, the related domains do not necessarily share such a common rating pattern, and diversity among the related domains might outweigh the advantages of such common pattern, which may result in performance degradations. In this paper, we propose a novel cluster-level based latent factor model to enhance the cross-domain recommendation, which can not only learn the common rating pattern shared across domains with the flexibility in controlling the optimal level of sharing, but also learn the domain-specific rating patterns of users in each domain that involve the discriminative information propitious to performance improvement. To this end, the proposed model is formulated as an optimization problem based on joint nonnegative matrix tri-factorization and an efficient alternating minimization algorithm is developed with convergence guarantee.

Existing anonymization techniques are not applicable to such datasets, and the problem cannot be tackled based on popular, multi-objective optimization strategies. This work proposes the first approach to address this problem.

Existing literature studies influence at the level of individuals, mostly ignoring the existence of a community structure in which multiple nodes may exhibit a common influence pattern. In this paper we introduce CSI, a model for analyzing information propagation and social influence at the granularity of communities. CSI builds over a novel propagation model that generalizes the classic Independent Cascade model to deal with groups of nodes instead of single nodes influence. Given a social network and a database of past information propagation, we propose a hierarchical approach to detect a set of communities and their reciprocal influence strength. CSI provides a higher level and more intuitive description of the influence dynamics, thus representing a powerful tool to summarize and investigate patterns of influence in large social networks. The evaluation on various datasets suggests the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modeling information propagation at the level of communities. It further enables to detect interesting patterns of influence, such as the communities that play a key role in the overall diffusion process, or that are likely to start information cascades.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

In this paper we provide such an experimental study. We combine a variety of graph construction methods as well as a vari- ety of graph-based SSL algorithms and empirically compare them on a number of benchmark data sets widely used in the SSL literature. The empirical evaluation proposed in this paper is subdivided into four parts: (1) best case analysis; (2) classifiers' stability evaluation; (3) influence of graph construction; and (4) influence of regularization parameters. The purpose of our experiments is to evaluate the trade-off between classifi- cation performance and stability of the SSL algorithms on a variety of graph construction methods and parameter values. The obtained results show that the mutual k-nearest neighbors (mutKNN) graph may be the best choice for adjacency graph construction while the RBF kernel may be the best choice for weighted matrix generation. In addition, mutKNN tends to generate smoother error surfaces than other adjacency graph construction methods. However, mutKNN is unstable for a relatively small value of k. Our results indicate that the classification performance of the graph-based SSL algorithms are heavily influenced by the parame- ters setting and we found no evident explorable pattern to relay to future practitioners.

Rich information associated with multi-typed nodes in heterogeneous networks motivates us to propose a new definition of outliers, which is different from those defined for homogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Community Distribution Outliers (CDOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks, which are defined as objects whose community distribution does not follow any of the popular community distribution patterns.We extract such outliers using a type-aware joint analysis of multiple types of objects. Given community membership matrices for all types of objects, we follow an iterative two-stage approach which performs pattern discovery and outlier detection in a tightly integrated manner. We first propose a novel outlier-aware approach based on joint non-negative matrix factorization to discover popular community distribution patterns for all the object types in a holistic manner, and then detect outliers based on such patterns.

We demonstrate how a naive classifier considering the temporal component only outperforms a lot of current state-of-the-art classifiers on real data streams that have temporal dependence, i.e. data is autocorrelated.

A key challenge is that individual users evaluate and act according to their own utility function, but that the system aims to optimize collective satisfaction.

Despite its many elegant properties, the brute force kNN graph construction method has computational complexity of On 2, which is prohibitive for large scale data sets. In this paper, based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, we propose an efficient algorithm for approximating kNN graphs, which has the time complexity of Old+lognn only d is the dimensionality and l is usually a small number. This is much faster than most existing fast methods. Specifically, we engage the locality sensitive hashing technique to divide items into small subsets with equal size, and then build one kNN graph on each subset using the brute force method. To enhance the approximation quality, we repeat this procedure for several times to generate multiple basic approximate graphs, and combine them to yield a high quality graph.

Forest-Based Point Process for Event Prediction from Electronic Health Records,Jeremy C. Weiss (University of Wisconsin-Madison);David Page (University of Wisconsin-Madison);,"2152678131,1975712082","Accurate prediction of future onset of disease from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has important clinical and economic implica- tions. In this domain the arrival of data comes at semi-irregular intervals and makes the prediction task challenging. We propose a method called multiplicative-forest point processes (MFPPs) that learns the rate of fu- ture events based on an event history. MFPPs join previous theory in multiplicative forest continuous-time Bayesian networks and piecewise- continuous conditional intensity models. We analyze the advantages of using MFPPs over previous methods and show that on synthetic and real EHR forecasting of heart attacks, MFPPs outperform earlier meth- ods and augment off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms. Ballooning medical costs and an aging population are forcing governments and health organizations to critically examine ways of providing improved care while meeting budgetary constraints. A leading candidate to fulfill this mandate is the advancement of personalized medicine, the field surrounding the customization of healthcare to individuals. Predictive models for future onset of disease are the tools of choice here, though the application of existing models to existing data has had mixed results. The research into improvements in predictive modeling has manifested in two main areas: better data and better models. Electronic health records (EHRs) now provide rich medical histories on individuals including diagnoses, medications, procedures, family history, genetic information, and so on. The individual may have regular check-ups interspersed with hospitalizations and medical emergen- cies, and the sequences of semi-irregular events can be considered as timelines. Unlike timelines, the majority of models incorporating time use a time-series data representation. In these models data are assumed to arrive at regular intervals. Irregular arrivals of events violate this assumption and lead to miss- ing data and/or aggregation, resulting in a loss of information. Experimen- tally, such methods have been shown to underperform analogous continuous-time models (1). To address the irregularity of medical event arrivals, we develop a continuous- time model: multiplicative-forest point processes (MFPPs).

A theoretical analysis shows that the demonstrated expert policy is near-optimal for the computed reward function. Not needing to repeatedly solve a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the ability to leverage existing techniques for classification and regression are two important advantages of the CSI approach.

Multi-core Structural SVM Training,Kai Wei Chang (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign);Vivek Srikumar (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign);Dan Roth (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign);,"2137603918,1151530292,2122007671","Many problems in natural language processing and computer vision can be framed as structured prediction problems. Structural support vector machines SVM is a popular approach for training structured predictors, where learning is framed as an optimization problem. Most structural SVM solvers alternate between a model update phase and an inference phase which predicts structures for all training examples. As structures become more complex, inference becomes a bottleneck and thus slows down learning considerably. In this paper, we propose a new learning algorithm for structural SVMs called DEMIDCD that extends the dual coordinate descent approach by decoupling the model update and inference phases into different threads. We take advantage of multicore hardware to parallelize learning with minimal synchronization between the model update and the inference phases.We prove that our algorithm not only converges but also fully utilizes all available processors to speed up learning, and validate our approach on two real-world NLP problems: part-of-speech tagging and relation extraction. In both cases, we show that our algorithm utilizes all available processors to speed up learning and achieves competitive performance. For example, it achieves a relative duality gap of 1% on a POS tagging problem in 192 seconds using 16 threads, while a standard implementation of a multi-threaded dual coordinate descent algorithm with the same number of threads requires more than 600 seconds to reach a solution of the same quality.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,theoretical computer science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

We introduce a modified spectral problem that uses all data points by constraining the latent projection of each point to be a local linear function of the landmarks' latent projections.

A popular algorithm of choice in practice for recovering M from the partially observed matrix using the low rank assumption is alternating least square ALS minimization, which involves optimizing over U and V in an alternating manner to minimize the squared error over observed entries while keeping the other factor fixed.

Modeling Short-Term Energy Load with Continuous Conditional Random Fields,Hongyu Guo (National Research Council);,2695291824,"Short-term energy load forecasting, such as hourly predictions for the next n (n ≤ 2) hours, will benefit from exploiting the relationships among the n estimated outputs. This paper treats such multi-steps ahead regression task as a sequence labeling (regression) problem, and adopts a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CCRF) strategy. This discriminative approach intuitively integrates two layers: the first layer aims at the prior knowledge for the multiple outputs, and the second layer employs edge potential features to implicitly model the interplays of the n interconnected outputs. Consequently, the proposed CCRF makes predictions not only basing on observed features, but also considering the estimated values of related outputs, thus improving the overall predictive accuracy. In particular, we boost the CCRF's predictive performance with a multi-target function as its edge feature. These functions convert the relationship of related outputs with continuous values into a set of ""sub-relationships"", each providing more specific feature constraints for the interplays of the related outputs. We applied the proposed approach to two real-world energy load prediction systems: one for electricity demand and another for gas usage. Our experimental results show that the proposed strategy can meaningfully reduce the predictive error for the two systems, in terms of mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error, when compared with three benchmarking methods. Promisingly, the relative error reduction achieved by our CCRF model was up to 50%.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,conditional random field;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;
A Theoretical Framework for Exploratory Data Mining: Recent Insights and Challenges Ahead,Tijl De Bie (University of Bristol);Eirini Spyropoulou (University of Bristol);,"2080198120,1981173521","Exploratory Data Mining (EDM), the contemporary heir of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) pioneered by Tukey in the seventies, is the task of facilitating the extraction of interesting nuggets of informa- tion from possibly large and complexly structured data. Major concep- tual challenges in EDM research are the understanding of how one can formalise a nugget of information (given the diversity of types of data of interest), and how one can formalise how interesting such a nugget of information is to a particular user (given the diversity of types of users and intended purposes). In this Nectar paper we briefly survey a number of recent contributions made by us and collaborators towards a theoret- ically motivated and practically usable resolution of these challenges. 1 Exploratory Data Mining From the seventies of the previous century, Tukey, Friedman, and collaborators advocated complementing research into statistical tools for confirmatory analy- sis of hypotheses with the development of tools that allow the interactive and exploratory analysis of data (24). The sort of techniques they proposed for this ranged from the very simple (the use of summary statistics for data, and sim- ple visual data summarisation techniques including the box plot as well as now largely obsolete techniques such as the stem-and-leaf plot), to advanced tech- niques for dimensionality reduction such as projection pursuit and its variants (6,10). While recognising the development of confirmatory analysis techniques (such as hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, allowing us to infer population properties from a sample) as one of the greatest achievements of the twentieth century, Tukey complained that ""Anything to which a confirmatory procedure was not explicitly attached was decried as 'mere descriptive statistics', no matter how much we learned from it."" Since then, data has evolved in size and complexity, and the techniques de- veloped in the past century for EDA are only rarely applicable in their basic unaltered form. Nevertheless, we argue that the problem identified by Tukey is greater than ever. Today's data size and complexity more often than not de- mand an extensive exploration stage by means of capable and intuitive EDM techniques, before predictive modelling or confirmatory analysis can realistically and usefully be applied.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,exploratory data analysis;data science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Markov chain Monte Carlo MCMC sampling algorithms are often employed for inference in such models. However, convergence of such algorithms is rather difficult to verify, and as the complexity of the task at hand increases, the computational cost of such algorithms often becomes prohibitive. These limitations can be overcome by variational techniques.

Experimental results on bench- mark data show that, in spite of using approximations, the approach is effective and yields good improvements in generalization performance over the plain su- pervised method.

Relying on Constraint Programming has two main advantages: the declarativity, which enables to easily add new constraints and the ability to find an optimal solution satisfying all the constraints (when there exists one). On the other hand, computation time depends on the constraints and on their ability to reduce the domain of variables, thus avoiding an exhaustive search.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,constrained clustering;constraint programming;constraint;systems modeling;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;
A Counterexample for the Validity of Using Nuclear Norm as a Convex Surrogate of Rank,Hongyang Zhang (Peking University);Zhouchen Lin (Peking University);Chao Zhang (Peking University);,"2146037803,2141729011,2656266591","Rank minimization has attracted a lot of attention due to its robustness in data recovery. To overcome the computational difficulty, rank is often replaced with nuclear norm. For several rank minimization problems, such a replacement has been theoretically proven to be valid, i.e., the solution to nuclear norm minimization problem is also the solution to rank minimization problem. Although it is easy to believe that such a replacement may not always be valid, no concrete example has ever been found. We argue that such a validity checking cannot be done by numerical computation and show, by analyzing the noiseless latent low rank representation LatLRR model, that even for very simple rank minimization problems the validity may still break down. As a by-product, we find that the solution to the nuclear norm minimization formulation of LatLRR is non-unique. Hence the results of LatLRR reported in the literature may be questionable.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,low rank approximation;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;

How Robust Is the Core of a Network,Abhijin Adiga (Virginia Bioinformatics Institute);Anil Kumar S. Vullikanti (Virginia Bioinformatics Institute);,"1919981802,393896382","The k-core is commonly used as a measure of importance and well connectedness for nodes in diverse applications in social networks and bioinformatics. Since network data is commonly noisy and incomplete, a fundamental issue is to understand how robust the core decomposition is to noise. Further, in many settings, such as online social media networks, usually only a sample of the network is available. Therefore, a related question is: How robust is the top core set under such sampling? We find that, in general, the top core is quite sensitive to both noise and sampling; we quantify this in terms of the Jaccard similarity of the set of top core nodes between the original and perturbed/sampled graphs. Most importantly, we find that the overlap with the top core set varies non-monotonically with the extent of perturbations/sampling. We explain some of these empirical observations by rigorous analysis in simple network models. Our work has important implications for the use of the core decomposition and nodes in the top cores in network analysis applications, and suggests the need for a more careful characterization of the missing data and sensitivity to it.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective score space which is essentially the sufficient statistics of the adopted generative models and does not involve the parameters of generative models. We further propose a discriminative learning method for the score space that seeks to utilize label information by constraining the classification margin over the score space. The form of score function allows the formulation of simple learning rules, which are essentially the same learning rules for a generative model with an extra posterior im- posed over its hidden variables.

Structured prediction in this case is multi-class categorization with the assumption that categories are taxonomically related. We make three main contributions: i We prove the equivalence between tree-structured covariance matrices and taxonomies; ii We use this covariance representation to develop a highly computationally efficient optimization algorithm for structured prediction with taxonomies; iii We show that the taxonomies learned from data using the Hilbert- Schmidt Independence Criterion HSIC often perform better than imputed semantic taxonomies.

In this paper, we present novel noisy data recovery models, which replaces the standard rank constraint i.e., trace norm using Schatten-p Norm. The proposed model is attractive due to its suppression on the shrinkage of singular values at smaller parameter p.

Multi-label Classification with Output Kernels,Yuhong Guo (Temple University);Dale Schuurmans (University of Alberta);,"2256485367,1817936516","Although multi-label classification has become an increasingly important problem in machine learning, current approaches remain restricted to learning in the original label space or in a simple linear projection of the original label space. Instead, we propose to use kernels on output label vectors to significantly expand the forms of label dependence that can be captured. The main challenge is to reformulate standard multi-label losses to handle kernels between output vectors. We first demonstrate how a state-of-the-art large margin loss for multi-label classification can be reformulated, exactly, to handle output kernels as well as input kernels. Importantly, the pre-image problem for multi-label classification can be easily solved at test time, while the training procedure can still be simply expressed as a quadratic program in a dual parameter space. We then develop a projected gradient descent training procedure for this new formulation.

Existing works exploit techniques to predict a trip destination, but they are effective only when location data are precise (e.g., GPS data) and movements are observed over long periods of time (e.g., weeks). We introduce a data mining approach based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that overcomes these limits and improves existing results in terms of precision of the prediction, for both the route (i.e., trajectory) and the final destination. The model is resistant to uncertain location data, as it works with data collected by using cell-towers to localize the users instead of GPS devices, and reaches good prediction results in shorter times (days instead of weeks in a representative real-world application). Finally, we introduce an enhanced version of the model that is orders of magnitude faster than the standard HMM implementation.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;

Existing Bayesian nonparametric models such as the sticky HDP-HMM are suitable only for single-layer segmentation. We propose the Layered Dirichlet Process LaDP, where each layer has a countable set of Dirichlet Processes, draws from which define a distribution over the countable set of Dirichlet Processes at the next layer. Each data item gets assigned to a distribution index from each layer of the hierarchy, leading to hierarchical segmentation of the sequence. The complexity of inference depends upon the exchangeability assumptions for the measures at different layers. We propose a new notion of exchangeability called Block Exchangeability, which lies between Markov Exchangeability used in HDP-HMM and Complete Group Exchangeability used in HDP, and allows for faster inference than Markov Exchangeability. Using experiments on a news transcript dataset and a product review dataset, we show that LaDP generalizes better than existing non-parametric models for sequential data, and by simultaneously segmenting at multiple levels, outperforms existing models in terms of single-layer segmentation. We also show empirically that using Block Exchangeability greatly speeds up inference and allows trading off accuracy for execution time.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,hierarchical dirichlet process;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

Applications vary, from extracting core subgroups in team performance data arising in sports, entertainment, research and business; to the discovery of functional complexes in high-throughput gene interaction data. A challenge in all of these scenarios is the large size of real-world networks and the computational complexity associated with clique enumeration. Furthermore, when mining for multiple cliques within the same network, the results need to be diversified in order to extract meaningful information that is both comprehensive and representative of the whole dataset. We formalize the problem of weighted diverse clique mining (mDKC) in large networks, incorporating both individual clique strength (measured by its weakest link) and diversity of the cliques in the result set. We show that the problem is NP-hard due to the diversity requirement. However, our formulation is sub-modular, and hence can be approximated within a constant factor from the optimal. We propose algorithms for mDKC that exploit the edge weight distribution in the input network and produce performance gains of more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to an exhaustive solution. One of our algorithms, Diverse Cliques (DiCliQ), guarantees a constant factor approximation while the other, Bottom Up Diverse Cliques (BUDiC), scales to large and dense networks without compromising the solution quality.

Learning Throttle Valve Control Using Policy Search,Bastian Bischoff (Bosch);Duy Nguyen-Tuong (Bosch);Torsten Koller (Bosch);Heiner Markert (Bosch);Alois Knoll (Technische Universität München);,"2038319787,1226131238,2277537075,2135251021,2498219411","The throttle valve is a technical device used for regulating a fluid or a gas flow. Throttle valve control is a challenging task, due to its complex dynamics and demanding constraints for the controller. Using state-of-the-art throttle valve control, such as model-free PID controllers, time-consuming and manual adjusting of the controller is necessary. In this paper, we investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) can help to alleviate the effort of manual controller design by automatically learning a control policy from experiences. In order to obtain a valid control policy for the throttle valve, several constraints need to be addressed, such as no-overshoot. Furthermore, the learned controller must be able to follow given desired trajectories, while moving the valve from any start to any goal position and, thus, multi-targets policy learning needs to be considered for RL. In this study, we employ a policy search RL approach, Pilco [2], to learn a throttle valve control policy. We adapt the Pilco algorithm, while taking into account the practical requirements and constraints for the controller. For evaluation, we employ the resulting algorithm to solve several control tasks in simulation, as well as on a physical throttle valve system. The results show that policy search RL is able to learn a consistent control policy for complex, real-world systems.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,control theory;simulation;

For instance, Bluetooth scanners store the MAC ad- dress of a device that can in principle be linked to a single person. Unique hashing of the address only partially solves the problem because such a pseudonym is still vulnerable to various linking attacks. In this paper we propose a solution to both tasks using an extension of linear counting sketches.

The vast amount of available proteomic data makes it possible to computationally annotate proteins. Most computational approaches predict protein functions by using the labeled proteins and assuming that the annotation of labeled proteins is complete, and without any missing functions. However, partially annotated proteins are common in real-world scenarios, that is a protein may have some confirmed functions, and whether it has other functions is unknown. In this paper, we make use of partially annotated proteomic data, and propose an approach called Protein Function Prediction using Dependency Maximization (ProDM). ProDM works by leveraging the correlation between different function labels, the 'guilt by association' rule between proteins, and maximizes the dependency between function labels and feature expression of proteins. ProDM can replenish the missing functions of partially annotated proteins (a seldom studied problem), and can predict functions for completely unlabeled proteins using partially annotated ones. An empirical study on publicly available protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks shows that, when the number of missing functions is large, ProDM performs significantly better than other related methods with respect to various evaluation criteria.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,protein function prediction;bioinformatics;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Discovering Nested Communities,Nikolaj Tatti (Helsinki Institute for Information Technology);Aristides Gionis (Helsinki Institute for Information Technology);,"1367500519,737311942","Finding communities in graphs is one of the most well- studied problems in data mining and social-network analysis. In many real applications, the underlying graph does not have a clear community structure. In those cases, selecting a single community turns out to be a fairly ill-posed problem, as the optimization criterion has to make a difficult choice between selecting a tight but small community or a more inclusive but sparser community. In order to avoid the problem of selecting only a single community we propose discovering a sequence of nested communities. More formally, given a graph and a starting set, our goal is to discover a sequence of communities all containing the starting set, and each community forming a denser subgraph than the next. Discovering an optimal sequence of communities is a complex optimization problem, and hence we divide it into two subproblems: 1 discover the optimal sequence for a fixed order of graph vertices, a subproblem that we can solve efficiently, and 2 find a good order. We employ a simple heuristic for discovering an order and we provide empirical and theoretical evidence that our order is good.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,combinatorics;bioinformatics;data mining;mathematics;

Most of the existing embedding algorithms perform to maintain the locality-preserving property. In this study, inspired by the remarkable success of representation learning and deep learning, we pro- pose a framework of embedding with autoencoder regularization (EAER for short), which incorporates embedding and autoencoding techniques naturally. In this framework, the original data are embedded into the lower dimension, represented by the output of the hidden layer of the autoencoder, thus the resulting data can not only maintain the locality- preserving property but also easily revert to their original forms. This is guaranteed by the joint minimization of the embedding loss and the autoencoder reconstruction error. It is worth mentioning that instead of operating in a batch mode as most of the previous embedding algo- rithms conduct, the proposed framework actually generates an induc- tive embedding model and thus supports incremental embedding effi- ciently. To show the effectiveness of EAER, we adapt this joint learning framework to three canonical embedding algorithms, and apply them to both synthetic and real-world data sets. The experimental results show that the adaption of EAER outperforms its original counterpart. Be- sides, compared with the existing incremental embedding algorithms, the results demonstrate that EAER performs incremental embedding with more competitive efficiency and effectiveness.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,semidefinite embedding;embedding;clustering high dimensional data;dimensionality reduction;feature learning;discrete mathematics;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;

The speed of the proposed method is demonstrated on an artificial dataset and a large real-world dataset, which shows that the standard VB-EM algorithm is not suitable for large datasets because it converges extremely slowly.

Nested Hierarchical Dirichlet Process for Nonparametric Entity-Topic Analysis,Priyanka Agrawal (IBM);Lavanya Sita Tekumalla (Indian Institute of Science);Indrajit Bhattacharya (IBM);,"2276692920,32906441,2117917354","The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process HDP is a Bayesian nonparametric prior for grouped data, such as collections of documents, where each group is a mixture of a set of shared mixture densities, or topics, where the number of topics is not fixed, but grows with data size. The Nested Dirichlet Process NDP builds on the HDP to cluster the documents, but allowing them to choose only from a set of specific topic mixtures. In many applications, such a set of topic mixtures may be identified with the set of entities for the collection. However, in many applications, multiple entities are associated with documents, and often the set of entities may also not be known completely in advance. In this paper, we address this problem using a nested HDP nHDP, where the base distribution of an outer HDP is itself an HDP. The inner HDP creates a countably infinite set of topic mixtures and associates them with entities, while the outer HDP associates documents with these entities or topic mixtures. Making use of a nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise nCRF representation for the nested HDP, we propose a collapsed Gibbs sampling based inference algorithm for the model. Because of couplings between two HDP levels, scaling up is naturally a challenge for the inference algorithm. We propose an inference algorithm by extending the direct sampling scheme of the HDP to two levels. In our experiments on two real world research corpora, we show that, even when large fractions of author entities are hidden, the nHDP is able to generalize significantly better than existing models.

However, in an active learning scenario, it is very difficult to accurately model labelers' expertise, because the quantity of instances labeled by all participating labelers is rather small. To solve this problem, we propose a new probabilistic model that transfers knowledge from a rich set of labeled instances in some auxiliary domains to help model labelers' expertise for active learning.

Given that analysts have only limited time, it is important that we can measure this with regard to what we already know. That is, we want to be able to measure whether a result is interesting from a subjective point of view. With this as our goal, we formalise how to probabilistically model real-valued data by the Maximum Entropy principle, where we allow statistics on arbitrary sets of cells as background knowledge. As statistics, we consider means and variances, as well as histograms. The resulting models allow us to assess the likelihood of values, and can be used to verify the significance of possibly overlapping structures discovered in the data. As we can feed those structures back in, our model enables iterative identification of subjectively interesting structures. To show the flexibility of our model, we propose a subjective informativeness measure for tiles, i.e. rectangular sub-matrices, in real-valued data. The Information Ratio quantifies how strongly the knowledge of a structure reduces our uncertainty about the data with the amount of effort it would cost to consider it. Empirical evaluation shows that iterative scoring effectively reduces redundancy in ranking candidate tiles--showing the applicability of our model for a range of data mining fields aimed at discovering structure in real-valued data.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;
Model-Selection for Non-parametric Function Approximation in Continuous Control Problems: A Case Study in a Smart Energy System,Daniel Urieli (University of Texas at Austin);Peter Stone (University of Texas at Austin);,"328872644,2147180669","This paper investigates the application of value-function-based reinforcement learning to a smart energy control system, specifically the task of controlling an HVAC system to minimize energy while satisfying residents' comfort requirements. In theory, value-function-based reinforcement learning methods can solve control problems such as this one optimally. However, since choosing an appropriate parametric representation of the value function turns out to be difficult, we develop an alternative method, which results in a practical algorithm for value function approximation in continuous state-spaces. To avoid the need to carefully design a parametric representation for the value function, we use a smooth non-parametric function approximator, specifically Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LWR). LWR is used within Fitted Value Iteration (FVI), which has met with several practical successes. However, for efficiency reasons, LWR is used with a limited sample-size, which leads to poor performance without careful tuning of LWR's parameters. We therefore develop an efficient meta-learning procedure that performs online model-selection and tunes LWR's parameters based on the Bellman error. Our algorithm is fully implemented and tested in a realistic simulation of the HVAC control domain, and results in significant energy savings.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;mathematical optimization;
Recognition of Agents Based on Observation of Their Sequential Behavior,Qifeng Qiao (University of Virginia);Peter A. Beling (University of Virginia);,"2129648420,279923867","We study the use of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) as a tool for recognition of agents on the basis of observation of their sequential decision behavior. We model the problem faced by the agents as a Markov decision process (MDP) and model the observed behavior of an agent in terms of forward planning for the MDP. The reality of the agent's decision problem and process may not be expressed by the MDP and its policy, but we interpret the observation as optimal actions in the MDP. We use IRL to learn reward functions for the MDP and then use these reward functions as the basis for clustering or classification models. Experimental studies with GridWorld, a navigation problem, and the secretary problem, an optimal stopping problem, show algorithms' performance in different learning scenarios for agent recognition where the agents' underlying decision strategy may be expressed by the MDP policy or not. Empirical comparisons of our method with several existing IRL algorithms and with direct methods that use feature statistics observed in state-action space suggest it may be superior for agent recognition problems, particularly when the state space is large but the length of the observed decision trajectory is small.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,partially observable markov decision process;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

While in the itemset setting it is suggestive to use the closed patterns as representatives for the relevant patterns, we argue that due to different properties of the space of sequential patterns, it is preferable to use the minimal generator sequences as representatives, instead of the closed sequences. Thereafter, we show that we can efficiently compute the relevant sequences via the minimal generators in the negatives. Unlike existing iterative or post-processing approaches for pattern subset selection, our approach thus results both in a reduction of the set of patterns and in a reduction of the search space  and hence in lower computational costs.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,discrete mathematics;data mining;machine learning;mathematics;

From the operational point of view predictions need to be tolerant to sensor failures such that the loss in accuracy due to temporary missing sensor readings would be minimal. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically analyze robustness of linear predictive models to temporary missing data. We demonstrate that if the input sensors are correlated the mean imputation of missing values may lead to a very rapid deterioration of the prediction accuracy. Based on the theoretical results we introduce a quantitative measure that allows to assess how robust is a given linear regression model to sensor failures.

Learning Graph-Based Representations for Continuous Reinforcement Learning Domains,Jan Hendrik Metzen (University of Bremen);,2051331017,"Graph-based domain representations have been used in discrete reinforcement learning domains as basis for, e.g., autonomous skill discovery and representation learning. These abilities are also highly relevant for learning in domains which have structured, continuous state spaces as they allow to decompose complex problems into simpler ones and reduce the burden of hand-engineering features. However, since graphs are inherently discrete structures, the extension of these approaches to continuous domains is not straight-forward. We argue that graphs should be seen as discrete, generative models of continuous domains. Based on this intuition, we define the likelihood of a graph for a given set of observed state transitions and derive a heuristic method entitled fige that allows to learn graph-based representations of continuous domains with large likelihood. Based on fige, we present a new skill discovery approach for continuous domains. Furthermore, we show that the learning of representations can be considerably improved by using fige.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,discrete mathematics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;
Sparse Relational Topic Models for Document Networks,Aonan Zhang (Tsinghua University);Jun Zhu (Tsinghua University);Bo Zhang (Tsinghua University);,"2141026239,2305755055,2438699337","Learning latent representations is playing a pivotal role in machine learning and many application areas. Previous work on relational topic models (RTM) has shown promise on learning latent topical representations for describing relational document networks and predicting pairwise links. However under a probabilistic formulation with normalization constraints, RTM could be ineffective in controlling the sparsity of the topical representations, and may often need to make strict mean-field assumptions for approximate inference. This paper presents sparse relational topic models (SRTM) under a non-probabilistic formulation that can effectively control the sparsity via a sparsity-inducing regularizer. Our model can also handle imbalance issues in real networks via introducing various cost parameters for positive and negative links. The deterministic optimization problem of SRTM admits efficient coordinate descent algorithms. We also present a generalization to consider all pairwise topic interactions.

To solve this problem, which we call greedy confidence pursuit, we develop a method based on posterior sampling.

Efficient Rank-one Residue Approximation Method for Graph Regularized Non-negative Matrix Factorization,Qing Liao (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology);Qian Zhang (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology);,"2433684365,2482558687","Nonnegative matrix factorization NMF aims to decompose a given data matrix X into the product of two lower-rank nonnegative factor matrices UV T . Graph regularized NMF GNMF is a recently proposed NMF method that preserves the geometric structure of X during such decomposition. Although GNMF has been widely used in computer vision and data mining, its multiplicative update rule MUR based solver suffers from both slow convergence and non-stationarity problems. In this paper, we propose a new efficient GNMF solver called rank-one residue approximation RRA. Different from MUR, which updates both factor matrices U and V as a whole in each iteration round, RRA updates each of their columns by approximating the residue matrix by their outer product. Since each column of both factor matrices is updated optimally in an analytic formulation, RRA is theoretical and empirically proven to converge rapidly to a stationary point. Moreover, since RRA needs neither extra computational cost nor parametric tuning, it enjoys a similar simplicity to MUR but performs much faster. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that RRA is much more efficient than MUR for GNMF. To confirm the stationarity of the solution obtained by RRA, we conduct clustering experiments on real-world image datasets by comparing with the representative solvers such as MUR and NeNMF for GNMF.

A Fast and Simple Method for Mining Subsequences with Surprising Event Counts,Jefrey Lijffijt (Helsinki Institute for Information Technology);,2682826872,"We consider the problem of mining subsequences with surprising event counts. When mining patterns, we often test a very large number of potentially present patterns, leading to a high likelihood of finding spurious results. Typically, this problem grows as the size of the data increases. Existing methods for statistical testing are not usable for mining patterns in big data, because they are either computationally too demanding, or fail to take into account the dependency structure between patterns, leading to true findings going unnoticed. We propose a new method to compute the significance of event frequencies in subsequences of a long data sequence. The method is based on analyzing the joint distribution of the patterns, omitting the need for randomization. We argue that computing the p-values exactly is computationally costly, but that an upper bound is easy to compute. We investigate the tightness of the upper bound and compare the power of the test with the alternative of post-hoc correction. We demonstrate the utility of the method on two types of data: text and DNA. We show that the proposed method is easy to implement and can be computed quickly. Moreover, we conclude that the upper bound is sufficiently tight and that meaningful results can be obtained in practice.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,multiple comparisons problem;big data;data mining;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Noisy-Or structure can decrease the data requirements by separating the influence of each parent thereby reducing greatly the number of parameters.

Tensors are multi-mode aka multi-way arrays, of whom vectors i.e., one-mode tensors and matrices i.e., two-mode tensors are special cases. We show that the tensor representation captures useful information that is difficult to provide in the conventional vector format. More importantly, to effectively utilize the rich information contained in tensors, we propose a novel semi-naive Bayesian tensor classification method which we call Bat that builds predictive models directly on data in tensor form instead of on their vectorizations. We apply Bat to supervised learning problems, and perform comprehensive experiments on classifying text documents and graphs, which demonstrate 1 the advantage of the tensor representation over conventional feature-vectorization approaches, and 2 the superiority of the proposed Bat tensor classifier over other existing learners.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,tensor product network;data mining;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

In this work, we study algorithms to monitor the result of a similarity join between nodes continuously, assuming a sliding window accommodating graph edges. Since the arrival of a new edge or the expiration of an existing one may change the similarity between several node pairs, the challenge is to maintain the similarity join result as efficiently as possible.

Analysis of sequence data could also benefit from this type of decomposition, but sequence datasets are not natively accepted by the Sparse Dictionary Learning model. A strategy for making sequence data more manageable is to extract all subsequences of a fixed length from the original sequence dataset. This subsequence representation can then be input to a Sparse Dictionary Learner. This strategy can be problematic because self-similar patterns within sequences are over-represented. In this work, we propose an alternative for applying Sparse Dictionary Learning to sequence datasets. We call this alternative Relevant Subsequence Dictionary Learning (RS-DL).

Properly Acting under Partial Observability with Action Feasibility Constraints,Caroline Ponzoni Carvalho Chanel (Institut supérieur de l'aéronautique et de l'espace);Florent Teichteil-Königsbuch;,"2081565632,204882187","We introduce Action-Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (AC-POMDP), which arose from studying critical robotic applications with damaging actions. AC-POMDPs restrict the optimized policy to only apply feasible actions: each action is feasible in a subset of the state space, and the agent can observe the set of applicable actions in the current hidden state, in addition to standard observations. We present optimality equations for AC-POMDPs, which imply to operate on α-vectors defined over many different belief subspaces. We propose an algorithm named PreCondition Value Iteration (PCVI), which fully exploits this specific property of AC-POMDPs about α-vectors. We also designed a relaxed version of PCVI whose complexity is exponentially smaller than PCVI. Experimental results on POMDP robotic benchmarks with action feasibility constraints exhibit the benefits of explicitly exploiting the semantic richness of action-feasibility observations in AC-POMDPs over equivalent but unstructured POMDPs.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,partially observable markov decision process;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical optimization;algorithm;mathematics;

Fast LSTD using stochastic approximation: Finite time analysis and application to traffic control,L. A. Prashanth (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation);Nathaniel Korda (University of Oxford);Rémi Munos (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation);,"1942240941,2071713583,254054780","We propose a stochastic approximation based method with randomisation of samples for policy evaluation using the least squares temporal difference (LSTD) algorithm. Our method results in an O(d) improvement in complexity in comparison to regular LSTD, where d is the dimension of the data. We provide convergence rate results for our proposed method, both in high probability and in expectation. Moreover, we also establish that using our scheme in place of LSTD does not impact the rate of convergence of the approximate value function to the true value function. This result coupled with the low complexity of our method makes it attractive for implementation in big data settings, where d is large. Further, we also analyse a similar low-complexity alternative for least squares regression and provide finite-time bounds there. We demonstrate the practicality of our method for LSTD empirically by combining it with the LSPI algorithm in a traffic signal control application. Several machine learning problems involve solving a linear system of equations from a given set of training data. In this paper we consider the problem of policy evaluation in reinforcement learning (RL) using the method of temporal differences (TD). Given a fixed training data set, one popular temporal difference algorithm for policy evaluation is LSTD Bradtke and Barto [1996]. However, LSTD is computationally expensive as it requiresO(d 2 ) computations. We propose a stochastic approximation (SA) based algorithm that draws data samples from a uniform distribution on the training set. From the finite time analyses that we provide, we observe our algorithm converges at the optimal rate, in high probability as well as in expectation. Moreover, using our scheme in place of LSTD does not impact the rate of convergence of the approximate value function to the true value function. This finding coupled with the significant decrease in the computational cost of our algorithm, makes it appealing in the canonical big data settings. The problem considered here is to estimate the value function V of a given policy . Temporal difference (TD) methods are well-known in this context, and they are known to converge to the fixed point V =T (V ), whereT is the Bellman operator (see Section 2.1 for a precise definition). A popular approach to overcome the curse of dimensionality associated with large state spaces is to parameterize the value function using a linear function approximation architecture. For every s in the state spaceS, we approximate V (s) T",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematical optimization;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
Semi-supervised Gaussian Process Ordinal Regression,P. K. Srijith (Indian Institute of Science);Shirish Krishnaj Shevade (Indian Institute of Science);S. Sundararajan (Microsoft);,"423720282,2054697475,2427243148","Ordinal regression problem arises in situations where exam- ples are rated in an ordinal scale. In practice, labeled ordinal data are difficult to obtain while unlabeled ordinal data are available in abun- dance. Designing a probabilistic semi-supervised classifier to perform ordinal regression is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel ap- proach for semi-supervised ordinal regression using Gaussian Processes (GP). It uses the expectation-propagation approximation idea, widely used for GP ordinal regression problem. The proposed approach makes use of unlabeled data in addition to the labeled data to learn a model by matching ordinal label distributions approximately between labeled and unlabeled data. The resulting mixed integer programming problem, involving model parameters (real-valued) and ordinal labels (integers) as variables, is solved efficiently using a sequence of alternating optimization steps. Experimental results on synthetic, bench-mark and real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed GP based approach makes effective use of the unlabeled data to give better generalization performance (on the absolute error metric, in particular) than the supervised approach. Thus, it is a useful approach for probabilistic semi-supervised ordinal regression problem.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,ordinal optimization;ordinal regression;ordinal data;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;
The Stochastic Gradient Descent for the Primal L1-SVM Optimization Revisited,Constantinos Panagiotakopoulos (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki);Petroula Tsampouka (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki);,"2422979668,88628260","We reconsider the stochastic (sub)gradient approach to the unconstrained primal L1-SVM optimization. We observe that if the learn- ing rate is inversely proportional to the number of steps, i.e., the number of times any training pattern is presented to the algorithm, the update rule may be transformed into the one of the classical perceptron with margin in which the margin threshold increases linearly with the number of steps. Moreover, if we cycle repeatedly through the possibly randomly permuted training set the dual variables defined naturally via the expan- sion of the weight vector as a linear combination of the patterns on which margin errors were made are shown to obey at the end of each complete cycle automatically the box constraints arising in dual optimization. This renders the dual Lagrangian a running lower bound on the primal objec- tive tending to it at the optimum and makes available an upper bound on the relative accuracy achieved which provides a meaningful stopping criterion. In addition, we propose a mechanism of presenting the same pattern repeatedly to the algorithm which maintains the above proper- ties. Finally, we give experimental evidence that algorithms constructed along these lines exhibit a considerably improved performance.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,combinatorics;machine learning;mathematical optimization;statistics;algorithm;mathematics;
A Unified Framework for Probabilistic Component Analysis,Mihalis A.

Under our framework, we unify many very popular and well-studied component analysis algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) and Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), some of which have no probabilistic equivalents in literature thus far. We firstly define the Markov Random Fields (MRFs) which encapsulate the latent connectivity of the aforementioned component analysis techniques; subsequently, we show that the projection directions produced by all PCA, LDA, LPP and SFA are also produced by the Maximum Likelihood (ML) solution of a single joint probability density function, composed by selecting one of the defined MRF priors while utilising a simple observation model. Furthermore, we propose novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms, exploiting the proposed joint PDF, while we generalize the proposed methodologies to arbitrary connectivities via parametrizable MRF products. Theoretical analysis and experiments on both simulated and real world data show the usefulness of the proposed framework, by deriving methods which well outperform state-of-the-art equivalents.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

SAYL combines SRL with the mar- keting concept of uplift modeling, uses the area under the uplift curve to direct clause construction and final theory evaluation, integrates rule learning and probability assignment, and conditions the addition of each new theory rule to existing ones. Breast cancer, the most common type of cancer among women, is cat- egorized into two subtypes: an earlier in situ stage where cancer cells are still confined, and a subsequent invasive stage. Currently older women with in situ cancer are treated to prevent cancer progression, regardless of the fact that treatment may generate undesirable side-effects, and the woman may die of other causes. Younger women tend to have more ag- gressive cancers, while older women tend to have more indolent tumors. Therefore older women whose in situ tumors show significant dissimilar- ity with in situ cancer in younger women are less likely to progress, and can thus be considered for watchful waiting. Motivated by this important problem, this work makes two main con- tributions. First, we present the first multi-relational uplift modeling system, and introduce, implement and evaluate a novel method to guide search in an SRL framework. Second, we compare our algorithm to pre- vious approaches, and demonstrate that the system can indeed obtain differential rules of interest to an expert on real data, while significantly improving the data uplift.",2013,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,medical research;text mining;data science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

In this paper, we revisit the problem of inferring latent network structure given observations from a diffusion process, such as the spread of trending topics in social media. We define a family of novel probabilistic models that can explain recurrent cascading behavior, and take into account not only the time differences between events but also a richer set of additional features. We show that MAP inference is tractable and can therefore scale to very large real-world networks. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by inferring the underlying network structure of a subset of the popular Twitter following network by analyzing the topics of a large number of messages posted by users over a 10-month period.

To understand the temporal behavior and characteristics of the dataset and its elements, we need effective tools that can capture evolution of the objects.

Given a series of snapshots of a temporal dataset, each of which consists of evolving communities, our goal is to find objects which evolve in a dramatically different way compared with the other community members. We define such objects as community trend outliers. It is a challenging problem as evolutionary patterns are hidden deeply in noisy evolving datasets and thus it is difficult to distinguish anomalous objects from normal ones. We propose an effective two-step procedure to detect community trend outliers. We first model the normal evolutionary behavior of communities across time using soft patterns discovered from the dataset. In the second step, we propose effective measures to evaluate chances of an object deviating from the normal evolutionary patterns.

Fast ALS-Based tensor factorization for context-aware recommendation from implicit feedback,Balázs Hidasi (Budapest University of Technology and Economics);Domonkos Tikk (Óbuda University);,"1950878799,165729861","Albeit the implicit feedback based recommendation problem--when only the user history is available but there are no ratings--is the most typical setting in real-world applications, it is much less researched than the explicit feedback case. State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on the explicit case cannot be straightforwardly transformed to the implicit case if scalability should be maintained. There are few implicit feedback benchmark datasets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicit benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedback recommender algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS applies a fast, ALS-based tensor factorization learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero elements in the tensor. The method also allows us to incorporate various contextual information into the model while maintaining its computational efficiency. We present two context-aware implementation variants of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables to distinguish user behavior in different time intervals. The other views the user history as sequential information and has the ability to recognize usage pattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apart product types that are typically purchased repetitively or once.

Given a project, our objective is to find a team of experts that covers all the required skills and also minimizes the communication cost as well as the personnel cost of the project. To minimize both of the objectives, we define a new combined cost function which is based on the linear combination of the objectives (i.e. communication and personnel costs). We show that the problem of minimizing the combined cost function is an NP-hard problem. Thus, one approximation algorithm is proposed to solve the problem.

Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information.

Unlike most prior work, we assume that the target phenomenon is known and we are given a method to count its occurrences in social media. However, counting is plagued by sample bias, incomplete data, and, paradoxically, data scarcity --- issues inadequately addressed by prior work. We formulate signal recovery as a Poisson point process estimation problem. We explicitly incorporate human population bias, time delays and spatial distortions, and spatio-temporal regularization into the model to address the noisy count issues.

We propose a Gaussian process regression based method for traffic volume estimation, which incorporates topological information and prior knowledge on preferred trajectories with a trajectory pattern kernel.

In this paper, we show how the classical technique of beam search may be used to solve both these problems. Specifically, we show how to use beam search to perform tractable test time inference, and how to integrate beam search with training to determine a suitable tag ordering.

Three key properties of the model are: (1) the inference algorithm converges in linear time, (2) learning of topics is simply a multiplication of two sparse matrices, (3) it provides a principled way to directly trade off sparsity of solutions against inference quality and running time. These properties enable us to speedily learn sparse topics and to infer sparse latent representations of documents, and help significantly save memory for storage. We show that inference in FSTM is actually MAP inference with an implicit prior. Extensive experiments show that FSTM can perform substantially better than various existing topic models by different performance measures.

Location affiliation networks: bonding social and spatial information,Konstantinos Pelechrinis (University of Pittsburgh);Prashant Krishnamurthy (University of Pittsburgh);,"155875377,2102746904","Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have recently attracted a lot of attention due to the number of novel services they can offer. Prior work on analysis of LBSNs has mainly focused on the social part of these systems. Even though it is important to know how different the structure of the social graph of an LBSN is as compared to the friendship-based social networks (SNs), it raises the interesting question of what kinds of linkages exist between locations and friendships. The main problem we are investigating is to identify such connections between the social and the spatial planes of an LBSN. In particular, in this paper we focus on answering the following general question ""What are the bonds between the social and spatial information in an LBSN and what are the metrics that can reveal them?"" In order to tackle this problem, we employ the idea of affiliation networks. Analyzing a dataset from a specific LBSN (Gowalla), we make two main interesting observations; (i) the social network exhibits signs of homophily with regards to the ""places/venues"" visited by the users, and (ii) the ""nature"" of the visited venues that are common to users is powerful and informative in revealing the social/spatial linkages. We further show that the ""entropy"" (or diversity) of a venue can be used to better connect spatial information with the existing social relations. The entropy records the diversity of a venue and requires only location history of users (it does not need temporal history). Finally, we provide a simple application of our findings for predicting existing friendship relations based on users' historic spatial information. We show that even with simple unsupervised learning models we can achieve significant improvement in prediction when we consider features that capture the ""nature"" of the venue as compared to the case where only apparent properties of the location history are used (e.g., number of common visits).",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;

In the domain of swarm robotics for instance, the expert can hardly design a reward function or demonstrate the target behavior, forbidding the use of both standard RL and inverse reinforcement learning. Although with a limited expertise, the human expert is still often able to emit preferences and rank the agent demonstrations. Earlier work has presented an iterative preference-based RL framework: expert preferences are exploited to learn an approximate policy return, thus enabling the agent to achieve direct policy search. Iteratively, the agent selects a new candidate policy and demonstrates it; the expert ranks the new demonstration comparatively to the previous best one; the expert's ranking feedback enables the agent to refine the approximate policy return, and the process is iterated. In this paper, preference-based reinforcement learning is combined with active ranking in order to decrease the number of ranking queries to the expert needed to yield a satisfactory policy. Experiments on the mountain car and the cancer treatment testbeds witness that a couple of dozen rankings enable to learn a competent policy.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,preference learning;error driven learning;learning classifier system;reinforcement learning;robotics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;computer science;
"Semi-supervised multi-label classification: a simultaneous large-margin, subspace learning approach",Yuhong Guo (Temple University);Dale Schuurmans (University of Alberta);,"2256485367,1817936516","Labeled data is often sparse in common learning scenarios, either because it is too time consuming or too expensive to obtain, while unlabeled data is almost always plentiful. This asymmetry is exacerbated in multi-label learning, where the labeling process is more complex than in the single label case. Although it is important to consider semi-supervised methods for multi-label learning, as it is in other learning scenarios, surprisingly, few proposals have been investigated for this particular problem. In this paper, we present a new semi-supervised multi-label learning method that combines large-margin multi-label classification with unsupervised subspace learning. We propose an algorithm that learns a subspace representation of the labeled and unlabeled inputs, while simultaneously training a supervised large-margin multi-label classifier on the labeled portion. Although joint training of these two interacting components might appear intractable, we exploit recent developments in induced matrix norm optimization to show that these two problems can be solved jointly, globally and efficiently. In particular, we develop an efficient training procedure based on subgradient search and a simple coordinate descent strategy.

In order to efficiently extract graph features from continuous node label distributions, and in general from continuous vector-valued node attributes, we utilize randomized techniques, which easily allow for deriving similarity measures based on propagated information. We show that propagation kernels utilizing locality-sensitive hashing reduce the runtime of existing graph kernels by several orders of magnitude.

Viral marketing for product cross-sell through social networks,Ramasuri Narayanam (IBM);Amit Anil Nanavati (IBM);,"1406309357,2170185937","The well known influence maximization problem [1] (or viral marketing through social networks) deals with selecting a few influential initial seeds to maximize the awareness of product(s) over the social network. In this paper, we introduce a novel and generalized version of the influence maximization problem that considers simultaneously the following three practical aspects: (i) Often cross-sell among products is possible, (ii) Product specific costs (and benefits) for promoting the products have to be considered, and (iii) Since a company often has budget constraints, the initial seeds have to be chosen within a given budget. We refer to this generalized problem setting as Budgeted Influence Maximization with Cross-sell of Products (B-IMCP). To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any work in the literature that addresses the B-IMCP problem which is the subject matter of this paper. Given a fixed budget, one of the key issues associated with the B-IMCP problem is to choose the initial seeds within this budget not only for the individual products, but also for promoting cross-sell phenomenon among these products. In particular, the following are the specific contributions of this paper: (i) We propose an influence propagation model to capture both the cross-sell phenomenon and product specific costs and benefits; (ii) As the B-IMCP problem is NP-hard computationally, we present a simple greedy approximation algorithm and then derive the approximation guarantee of this greedy algorithm by drawing upon the results from the theory of matroids; (iii) We then outline two efficient heuristics based on well known concepts in the literature. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the proposed approach for the B-IMCP problem using a few well known social network data sets such as WikiVote data set, Epinions, and Telecom call detail records data.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,matroid;cross selling;budget constraint;social network;management science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Most of the existing disambiguation methods are built on similarity measures, e.g., ""Jaccard Coefficient"", between two sets of papers to be disambiguated, each set represented by a set of categorical features, e.g., coauthors and published venues. Such measures perform bad when the two sets are small, which is typical in Author Name Disambiguation. In this paper, we propose a novel categorical set similarity measure. We model an author's preference, e.g., to venues, using a categorical distribution, and derive a likelihood ratio to estimate the likelihood that the two sets are drawn from the same distribution. This likelihood ratio is used as the similarity measure to decide whether two sets belong to the same author. This measure is mathematically principled and verified to perform well even when the cardinalities of the two compared sets are small.

Semi-supervised approaches using a small number of labeled examples together with many unlabeled examples are often unreliable as they frequently produce an internally consistent, but nevertheless, incorrect set of extractions.

Usually, the weight of a formula cannot be related to the probability of the formula without taking into account the weights of the other formulas. In general, this is not an issue, since the weights are learned from training data. However, in many domains (e.g. healthcare, dependable systems, etc.), only little or no training data may be available, but one has access to a domain expert whose knowledge is available in the form of subjective probabilities. Within the framework of Bayesian statistics, we present a formalism for using a domain expert's knowledge for weight learning. Our approach defines priors that are different from and more general than previously used Gaussian priors over weights. We show how one can learn weights in an MLN by combining subjective probabilities and training data, without requiring that the domain expert provides consistent knowledge. Additionally, we also provide a formalism for capturing conditional subjective probabilities, which are often easier to obtain and more reliable than non-conditional probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by extensive experiments in a domain that models failure dependencies in a cyber-physical system.

WikiSent: weakly supervised sentiment analysis through extractive summarization with wikipedia,Subhabrata Mukherjee (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay);Pushpak Bhattacharyya (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay);,"2301124665,2156071728","This paper describes a weakly supervised system for sentiment analysis in the movie review domain. The objective is to classify a movie review into a polarity class, positive or negative, based on those sentences bearing opinion on the movie alone, leaving out other irrelevant text. Wikipedia incorporates the world knowledge of movie-specific features in the system which is used to obtain an extractive summary of the review, consisting of the reviewer's opinions about the specific aspects of the movie. This filters out the concepts which are irrelevant or objective with respect to the given movie. The proposed system, WikiSent, does not require any labeled data for training. It achieves a better or comparable accuracy to the existing semi-supervised and unsupervised systems in the domain, on the same dataset. We also perform a general movie review trend analysis using WikiSent.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,brand;sentiment analysis;information extraction;text mining;information retrieval;data mining;pattern recognition;computer science;

Bayesian network classifiers with reduced precision parameters,Sebastian Tschiatschek (Graz University of Technology);Peter Reinprecht (Graz University of Technology);Manfred Mücke (University of Vienna);Franz Pernkopf (Graz University of Technology);,"341038388,2681074183,1988816017,199276077","Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) are probabilistic classifiers showing good performance in many applications. They consist of a directed acyclic graph and a set of conditional probabilities associated with the nodes of the graph. These conditional probabilities are also referred to as parameters of the BNCs. According to common belief, these classifiers are insensitive to deviations of the conditional probabilities under certain conditions. The first condition is that these probabilities are not too extreme, i.e. not too close to 0 or 1. The second is that the posterior over the classes is significantly different. In this paper, we investigate the effect of precision reduction of the parameters on the classification performance of BNCs. The probabilities are either determined generatively or discriminatively. Discriminative probabilities are typically more extreme. However, our results indicate that BNCs with discriminatively optimized parameters are almost as robust to precision reduction as BNCs with generatively optimized parameters. Furthermore, even large precision reduction does not decrease classification performance significantly. Our results allow the implementation of BNCs with less computational complexity. This supports application in embedded systems using floating-point numbers with small bit-width. Reduced bit-widths further enable to represent BNCs in the integer domain while maintaining the classification performance.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;
Influence spread in large-scale social networks --- a belief propagation approach,Huy Nguyen (University of Houston);Rong Zheng (University of Houston);,"2285876628,2248943465","Influence maximization is the problem of finding a small set of seed nodes in a social network that maximizes the spread of influence under a certain diffusion model.

In this work, we tackle both problems by devising efficient algorithms to compute influence spread and determine the best candidate for seed selection. The fundamental insight behind the proposed algorithms is the linkage between influence spread determination and belief propagation on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Lifted online training of relational models with stochastic gradient methods,Babak Ahmadi (Fraunhofer Society);Kristian Kersting (Fraunhofer Society);Sriraam Natarajan (Wake Forest University);,"2151199892,2252032993,2156930872","Lifted inference approaches have rendered large, previously intractable probabilistic inference problems quickly solvable by employing symmetries to handle whole sets of indistinguishable random variables. Still, in many if not most situations training relational models will not benefit from lifting: symmetries within models easily break since variables become correlated by virtue of depending asymmetrically on evidence. An appealing idea for such situations is to train and recombine local models. This breaks long-range dependencies and allows to exploit lifting within and across the local training tasks. Moreover, it naturally paves the way for online training for relational models. Specifically, we develop the first lifted stochastic gradient optimization method with gain vector adaptation, which processes each lifted piece one after the other. On several datasets, the resulting optimizer converges to the same quality solution over an order of magnitude faster, simply because unlike batch training it starts optimizing long before having seen the entire mega-example even once.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;statistics;mathematics;

In this paper, we approach this challenge through a combination of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, feature selection strategies, and convolution techniques from the signal processing field. As a result, our algorithm produces a good decomposition of a given time series and, as a side effect, builds a compact representation of its identified components.

By using low-rank approximations in the context models, the models perform latent semantic analyses and can generalize across specific terms, i.e., the model might use similar latent representations for semantically related terms. All the approaches we are considering have unique solutions. They can exploit sparse matrix algebra and are thus highly scalable and can easily be generalized to new entities. We evaluate the effectiveness of nonlinear interaction terms and reduce the number of terms by applying feature selection.

Handling time changing data with adaptive very fast decision rules,Petr Kosina (Masaryk University);João Gama (University of Porto);,"2067500809,2113857198","Data streams are usually characterized by changes in the underlying distribution generating data. Therefore algorithms designed to work with data streams should be able to detect changes and quickly adapt the decision model.

In this paper we present the Adaptive Very Fast Decision Rules (AVFDR), an on-line, any-time and one-pass algorithm for learning decision rules in the context of time changing data. AVFDR can learn ordered and unordered rule sets. It is able to adapt the decision model via incremental induction and specialization of rules. Detecting local drifts takes advantage of the modularity of rule sets. In AVFDR, each individual rule monitors the evolution of performance metrics to detect concept drift. AVFDR prunes rules that detect drift. This explicit change detection mechanism provides useful information about the dynamics of the process generating data, faster adaption to changes and generates compact rule sets. The experimental evaluation shows this method is able to learn fast and compact rule sets from evolving streams in comparison to alternative methods.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

We introduce error-correcting output codes (ECOCs) in this setting and propose two new methods for reducing complexity when using rollouts-based approaches. The first method consists in using an ECOC-based classifier as the multiclass classifier, reducing the learning complexity from $\mathcal{O}(A^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(A \log(A))$. We then propose a novel method that profits from the ECOC's coding dictionary to split the initial MDP into $\mathcal{O}(\log(A))$ separate two-action MDPs.

Bayesian nonparametric inverse reinforcement learning,Bernard Michini (Massachusetts Institute of Technology);Jonathan P.

Current IRL algorithms attempt to find a single reward function which explains the entire observation set. In practice, this leads to a computationally-costly search over a large (typically infinite) space of complex reward functions. This paper proposes the notion that if the observations can be partitioned into smaller groups, a class of much simpler reward functions can be used to explain each group. The proposed method uses a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model to automatically partition the data and find a set of simple reward functions corresponding to each partition. The simple rewards are interpreted intuitively as subgoals, which can be used to predict actions or analyze which states are important to the demonstrator. Experimental results are given for simple examples showing comparable performance to other IRL algorithms in nominal situations. Moreover, the proposed method handles cyclic tasks (where the agent begins and ends in the same state) that would break existing algorithms without modification. Finally, the new algorithm has a fundamentally different structure than previous methods, making it more computationally efficient in a real-world learning scenario where the state space is large but the demonstration set is small.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,reward based selection;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Analyzing text and social network data with probabilistic models,"Padhraic Smyth (University of California, Irvine);",2137074633,"Exploring and understanding large text and social network data sets is of increasing interest across multiple fields, in computer science, social science, history, medicine, and more. This talk will present an overview of recent work using probabilistic latent variable models to analyze such data. Latent variable models have a long tradition in data analysis and typically hypothesize the existence of simple unobserved phenomena to explain relatively complex observed data. In the past decade there has been substantial work on extending the scope of these approaches from relatively small simple data sets to much more complex text and network data. We will discuss the basic concepts behind these developments, reviewing key ideas, recent advances, and open issues. In addition we will highlight common ideas that lie beneath the surface of different approaches including links (for example) to work in matrix factorization.

Differentially private projected histograms: construction and use for prediction,"Staal A. Vinterbo (University of California, San Diego);",213434284,"Privacy concerns are among the major barriers to efficient secondary use of information and data on humans. Differential privacy is a relatively recent measure that has received much attention in machine learning as it quantifies individual risk using a strong cryptographically motivated notion of privacy. At the core of differential privacy lies the concept of information dissemination through a randomized process. One way of adding the needed randomness to any process is to pre-randomize the input. This can yield lower quality results than other more specialized approaches, but can be an attractive alternative when i. there does not exist a specialized differentially private alternative, or when ii. multiple processes applied in parallel can use the same pre-randomized input. A simple way to do input randomization is to compute perturbed histograms, which essentially are noisy multiset membership functions. Unfortunately, computation of perturbed histograms is only efficient when the data stems from a low-dimensional discrete space. The restriction to discrete spaces can be mitigated by discretization; Lei presented in 2011 an analysis of discretization in the context of M-estimators. Here we address the restriction regarding the dimensionality of the data. In particular we present a differentially private approximation algorithm for selecting features that preserve conditional frequency densities, and use this to project data prior to computing differentially private histograms. The resulting projected histograms can be used as machine learning input and include the necessary randomness for differential privacy. We empirically validate the use of differentially private projected histograms for learning binary and multinomial logistic regression models using four real world data sets.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,theoretical computer science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

When the loss is nonsmooth, we present a novel SCD algorithm, in which the one-variable subproblem is solved using the dual averaging method.

Improving robustness and flexibility of concept taxonomy learning from text,Fabio Leuzzi (University of Bari);Stefano Ferilli (Logica);Fulvio Rotella (University of Bari);,"2078471377,1970347819,2134974295","The spread and abundance of electronic documents requires automatic techniques for extracting useful information from the text they contain. The availability of conceptual taxonomies can be of great help, but manually building them is a complex and costly task. Building on previous work, we propose a technique to automatically extract conceptual graphs from text and reason with them. Since automated learning of taxonomies needs to be robust with respect to missing or partial knowledge and flexible with respect to noise, this work proposes a way to deal with these problems. The case of poor data/sparse concepts is tackled by finding generalizations among disjoint pieces of knowledge. Noise is handled by introducing soft relationships among concepts rather than hard ones, and applying a probabilistic inferential setting. In particular, we propose to reason on the extracted graph using different kinds of relationships among concepts, where each arc/relationship is associated to a weight that represents its likelihood among all possible worlds, and to face the problem of sparse knowledge by using generalizations among distant concepts as bridges between disjoint portions of knowledge.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Efficient discovery of association rules and frequent itemsets through sampling with tight performance guarantees,Matteo Riondato (Brown University);Eli Upfal (Brown University);,"1555209364,2685185700","The tasks of extracting (top-K) Frequent Itemsets (FI's) and Association Rules (AR's) are fundamental primitives in data mining and database applications. Exact algorithms for these problems exist and are widely used, but their running time is hindered by the need of scanning the entire dataset, possibly multiple times. High quality approximations of FI's and AR's are sufficient for most practical uses, and a number of recent works explored the application of sampling for fast discovery of approximate solutions to the problems. However, these works do not provide satisfactory performance guarantees on the quality of the approximation, due to the difficulty of bounding the probability of under- or over-sampling any one of an unknown number of frequent itemsets. In this work we circumvent this issue by applying the statistical concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension to develop a novel technique for providing tight bounds on the sample size that guarantees approximation within user-specified parameters. Our technique applies both to absolute and to relative approximations of (top-K) FI's and AR's. The resulting sample size is linearly dependent on the VC-dimension of a range space associated with the dataset to be mined. The main theoretical contribution of this work is a characterization of the VC-dimension of this range space and a proof that it is upper bounded by an easy-to-compute characteristic quantity of the dataset which we call d-index, namely the maximum integer d such that the dataset contains at least d transactions of length at least d. We show that this bound is strict for a large class of datasets. The resulting sample size for an absolute (resp. relative) (e, δ)-approximation of the collection of FI's is $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}(d+\log\frac{1}{\delta}))$ (resp. $O(\frac{2+\varepsilon}{\varepsilon^2(2-\varepsilon)\theta}(d\log\frac{2+\varepsilon}{(2-\varepsilon)\theta}+\log\frac{1}{\delta}))$) transactions, which is a significant improvement over previous known results. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of our technique on real and artificial datasets, demonstrating the practicality of our methods, and showing that they achieve even higher quality approximations than what is guaranteed by the analysis.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,combinatorics;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;mathematics;

Commonly these methods are stated as optimization problems and employ the extremal (maximal or minimal) eigenvectors of a certain input matrix for deriving the appropriate statistical inferences. Interestingly, recent studies have questioned this ""modus operandi"" and revealed that useful information may also be present within low-order eigenvectors whose mass is concentrated (localized) in a small part of their indexes. An application context where localized low-order eigenvectors have been successfully employed is ""Differential Power Analysis"" (DPA). DPA is a well studied side-channel attack on cryptographic hardware devices (such as smart cards) that employs statistical analysis of the device's power consumption in order to retrieve the secret key of the cryptographic algorithm. In this work we propose a data mining (clustering) formulation of the DPA process and also provide a theoretical model that justifies and explains the utility of low-order eigenvectors. In our data mining formulation, we consider that the key-relevant information is modelled as a ""low-signal"" pattern that is embedded in a ""high-noise"" dataset.

We propose Stijl, a greedy any-time algorithm for mining good tile trees from binary data. Iteratively, it finds the locally optimal addition to the current tree, allowing overlap with tiles of the same parent. A major result of this paper is that we find the optimal tile in only Θ(NM min(N,M)) time.

Cooper (University of Pittsburgh);Milos Hauskrecht (University of Pittsburgh);,"1841724547,2137326150,85581826","Rule mining is an important class of data mining methods for discovering interesting patterns in data. The success of a rule mining method heavily depends on the evaluation function that is used to assess the quality of the rules. In this work, we propose a new rule evaluation score - the Predictive and Non-Spurious Rules (PNSR) score. This score relies on Bayesian inference to evaluate the quality of the rules and considers the structure of the rules to filter out spurious rules. We present an efficient algorithm for finding rules with high PNSR scores. The experiments demonstrate that our method is able to cover and explain the data with a much smaller rule set than existing methods.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,association rule learning;medical research;text mining;data science;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;

Because query distributions and item relevance change over time, ranking models often cannot be evaluated accurately on held-out training data. Instead, considerable effort is spent on manually labeling the relevance of query results for test queries in order to track ranking performance. We address the problem of estimating ranking performance as accurately as possible on a fixed labeling budget. Estimates are based on a set of most informative test queries selected by an active sampling distribution. Query labeling costs depend on the number of result items as well as item-specific attributes such as document length.

Learning bi-clustered vector autoregressive models,Tzu-Kuo Huang (Carnegie Mellon University);Jeff G. Schneider (Carnegie Mellon University);,"2104512981,2165347984","Vector Auto-regressive (VAR) models are useful for analyzing temporal dependencies among multivariate time series, known as Granger causality. There exist methods for learning sparse VAR models, leading directly to causal networks among the variables of interest. Another useful type of analysis comes from clustering methods, which summarize multiple time series by putting them into groups. We develop a methodology that integrates both types of analyses, motivated by the intuition that Granger causal relations in real-world time series may exhibit some clustering structure, in which case the estimation of both should be carried out together. Our methodology combines sparse learning and a nonparametric bi-clustered prior over the VAR model, conducting full Bayesian inference via blocked Gibbs sampling. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate improvements in both model estimation and clustering quality over standard alternatives, and in particular biologically more meaningful clusters in a T-cell activation gene expression time series dataset than those by other methods.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,time series;gene expression;econometrics;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;
Machine learning for robotics,"Pieter Abbeel (University of California, Berkeley);",243981275,"Robots are typically far less capable in autonomous mode than in tele-operated mode. The few exceptions tend to stem from long days (and more often weeks, or even years) of expert engineering for a specific robot and its operating environment. Current control methodology is quite slow and labor intensive. I believe advances in machine learning have the potential to revolutionize robotics. In this talk, I will present new machine learning techniques we have developed that are tailored to robotics. I will describe in depth ""Apprenticeship learning"", a new approach to high-performance robot control based on learning for control from ensembles of expert human demonstrations. Our initial work in apprenticeship learning has enabled the most advanced helicopter aerobatics to-date, including maneuvers such as chaos, tic-tocs, and auto-rotation landings which only exceptional expert human pilots can fly. Our most recent work in apprenticeship learning is providing traction on learning to perform challenging robotic manipulation tasks, such as knot-tying.

Sparse gaussian processes for multi-task learning,Yuyang Wang (Tufts University);Roni Khardon (Tufts University);,"2132792684,639666141","Multi-task learning models using Gaussian processes (GP) have been recently developed and successfully applied in various applications. The main difficulty with this approach is the computational cost of inference using the union of examples from all tasks. The paper investigates this problem for the grouped mixed-effect GP model where each individual response is given by a fixed-effect, taken from one of a set of unknown groups, plus a random individual effect function that captures variations among individuals. Such models have been widely used in previous work but no sparse solutions have been developed. The paper presents the first sparse solution for such problems, showing how the sparse approximation can be obtained by maximizing a variational lower bound on the marginal likelihood, generalizing ideas from single-task Gaussian processes to handle the mixed-effect model as well as grouping. Experiments using artificial and real data validate the approach showing that it can recover the performance of inference with the full sample, that it outperforms baseline methods, and that it outperforms state of the art sparse solutions for other multi-task GP formulations.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,sparse approximation;econometrics;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

It is particularly useful when each task has very limited labeled data. A central issue in multi-task learning is to learn and exploit the relationships between tasks. In this paper, we generalize boosting to the multi-task learning setting and propose a method called multi-task boosting (MTBoost). Different tasks in MTBoost share the same base learners but with different weights which are related to the estimated task relationships in each iteration. In MTBoost, unlike ordinary boosting methods, the base learners, weights and task covariances are learned together in an integrated fashion using an alternating optimization procedure.

This leads to more appropriate propagation of side-information among tasks and provides potential for further improving the performance. We propose the concept of geometry preserving probability (PG) and show that our framework leads to a larger PG in theory.

A framework for evaluating the smoothness of data-mining results,Gaurav Misra (Boston University);Behzad Golshan (Boston University);Evimaria Terzi (Boston University);,"2280675396,2056540169,2110675235","The data-mining literature is rich in problems that are formalized as combinatorial-optimization problems. An indicative example is the entity-selection formulation that has been used to model the problem of selecting a subset of representative reviews from a review corpus [11,22]or important nodes in a social network [10]. Existing combinatorial algorithms for solving such entity-selection problems identify a set of entities (e.g., reviews or nodes) as important. Here, we consider the following question: how do small or large changes in the input dataset change the value or the structure of the such reported solutions? We answer this question by developing a general framework for evaluating the smoothness (i.e, consistency) of the data-mining results obtained for the input dataset X. We do so by comparing these results with the results obtained for datasets that are within a small or a large distance from X. The algorithms we design allow us to perform such comparisons effectively and thus, approximate the results' smoothness efficiently.

A variety of voter models have been defined that help analyze how people make decisions based on their neighbors' decisions. In these studies, common practice has been to use the latest decisions in opinion formation process. However, people may decide their opinions by taking account not only of their neighbors' latest opinions, but also of their neighbors' past opinions. To incorporate this effect, we enhance the original voter model and define the temporal decay voter (TDV) model incorporating a temporary decay function with parameters, and propose an efficient method of learning these parameters from the observed opinion diffusion data. We further propose an efficient method of selecting the most appropriate decay function from among the candidate functions each with the optimized parameter values. We adopt three functions as the typical candidates: the exponential decay, the power-law decay, and no decay, and evaluate the proposed method (parameter learning and model selection) through extensive experiments. We, first, experimentally demonstrate, by using synthetic data, the effectiveness of the proposed method, and then we analyze the real opinion diffusion data from a Japanese word-of-mouth communication site for cosmetics using three decay functions above, and show that most opinions conform to the TDV model of the power-law decay function.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;statistics;

More specifically, we argue that the Plackett-Luce ranking model is a very natural choice in this context, especially as it can be seen as a multinomial extension of the Bradley-Terry model. The latter provides the basis of pairwise coupling techniques, which arguably constitute the state-of-the-art in multi-class probability estimation.

Declarative modeling for machine learning and data mining,Luc De Raedt (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven);,189137728,"Despite the popularity of machine learning and data mining today, it remains challenging to develop applications and software that incorporates machine learning or data mining techniques. This is because machine learning and data mining have focussed on developing high-performance algorithms for solving particular tasks rather than on developing general principles and techniques. I propose to alleviate these problems by applying the constraint programming methodology to machine learning and data mining and to specify machine learning and data mining problems as constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. What is essential is that the user be provided with a way to declaratively specify what the machine learning or data mining problem is rather than having to outline how that solution needs to be computed. This corresponds to a model + solver-based approach to machine learning and data mining, in which the user specifies the problem in a high level modeling language and the system automatically transforms such models into a format that can be used by a solver to efficiently generate a solution. This should be much easier for the user than having to implement or adapt an algorithm that computes a particular solution to a specific problem.

Smoothing categorical data,Arno Siebes (Utrecht University);René Kersten (Utrecht University);,"1988376837,2474388960","Global models of a dataset reflect not only the large scale structure of the data distribution, they also reflect small(er) scale structure. Hence, if one wants to see the large scale structure, one should somehow subtract this smaller scale structure from the model. While for some kinds of model --- such as boosted classifiers --- it is easy to see the ""important"" components, for many kind of models this is far harder, if at all possible. In such cases one might try an implicit approach: simplify the data distribution without changing the large scale structure. That is, one might first smooth the local structure out of the dataset. Then induce a new model from this smoothed dataset. This new model should now reflect the large scale structure of the original dataset. In this paper we propose such a smoothing for categorical data and for one particular type of models, viz., code tables.

A bayesian approach for classification rule mining in quantitative databases,Marc Boullé (Orange S.A.);,743486302,"We suggest a new framework for classification rule mining in quantitative data sets founded on Bayes theory --- without univariate preprocessing of attributes. We introduce a space of rule models and a prior distribution defined on this model space. As a result, we obtain the definition of a parameter-free criterion for classification rules. We show that the new criterion identifies interesting classification rules while being highly resilient to spurious patterns. We develop a new parameter-free algorithm to mine locally optimal classification rules efficiently. The mined rules are directly used as new features in a classification process based on a selective naive Bayes classifier. The resulting classifier demonstrates higher inductive performance than state-of-the-art rule-based classifiers.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,classification rule;bayes classifier;probabilistic classification;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;mathematics;
Hypergraph spectra for semi-supervised feature selection,Zhihong Zhang (University of York);Edwin R. Hancock (University of York);Xiao Bai (Beihang University);,"2542471538,2047018924,2136098704","In many data analysis tasks, one is often confronted with the problem of selecting features from very high dimensional data. Most existing feature selection methods focus on ranking individual features based on a utility criterion, and select the optimal feature set in a greedy manner. However, the feature combinations found in this way do not give optimal classification performance, since they neglect the correlations among features. While the labeled data required by supervised feature selection can be scarce, there is usually no shortage of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph based semi-supervised feature selection algorithm to select relevant features using both labeled and unlabeled data. There are two main contributions in this paper. The first is that by incorporating multidimensional interaction information (MII) for higher order similarities measure, we establish a novel hypergraph framework which is used for characterizing the multiple relationships within a set of samples. Thus, the structural information latent in the data can be more effectively modeled. Secondly, we derive a hypergraph subspace learning view of feature selection which casting the feature discriminant analysis into a regression framework that considers the correlations among features. As a result, we can evaluate joint feature combinations, rather than being confined to consider them individually. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature selection method on a number of standard face data-sets.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,dimensionality reduction;feature;feature selection;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;
Bidirectional semi-supervised learning with graphs,Tomoharu Iwata (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone);Kevin Duh (Nara Institute of Science and Technology);,"2108993706,2046721439","We present a machine learning task, which we call bidirectional semi-supervised learning, where label-only samples are given as well as labeled and unlabeled samples. A label-only sample contains the label information of the sample but not the feature information. Then, we propose a simple and effective graph-based method for bidirectional semi-supervised learning in multi-label classification. The proposed method assumes that correlated classes are likely to have the same labels among the similar samples. First, we construct a graph that represents similarities between samples using labeled and unlabeled samples in the same way with graph-based semi-supervised methods. Second, we construct another graph using labeled and label-only samples by connecting classes that are likely to co-occur, which represents correlations between classes. Then, we estimate labels of unlabeled samples by propagating labels over these two graphs. We can find a closed-form global solution for the label propagation by using matrix algebra. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over supervised and semi-supervised learning methods with experiments using synthetic and multi-label text data sets.",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,semi supervised learning;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

High-performance distributed computing frameworks and protocols, such as the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and MapReduce, have been proposed to facilitate software development on grid infrastructures, enabling analysts to process large-scale problems efficiently. This paper presents a novel large-scale feature selection algorithm that is based on variance analysis. The algorithm selects features by evaluating their abilities to explain data variance. It supports both supervised and unsupervised feature selection and can be readily implemented in most distributed computing environments. The algorithm was developed as a SAS High-Performance Analytics procedure, which can read data in distributed form and perform parallel feature selection in both symmetric multiprocessing mode and massively parallel processing mode.

The approach is based on measuring the (generalized) correlation or synchrony between the auditory content and physiological signals reflecting the state of the user. We hypothesize that the synchrony is higher when the user is paying attention to the content, and show empirically that the level of attention can indeed be inferred based on the correlation.

To realize this potential, effective high content screening for drug candidates is required. Analysis of images from high content screening typically requires DNA staining to identify cell nuclei to do cell segmentation before feature extraction and classification.

In this paper, we introduced a novel Information Distance Classification (IDC) method, requiring no segmentation or feature extraction; hence no DNA staining is needed.

Adaptive two-view online learning for math topic classification,Tam T. Nguyen (Nanyang Technological University);Kuiyu Chang (Nanyang Technological University);Siu Cheung Hui (Nanyang Technological University);,"2119014062,2147346151,2166513862","Text categorization has been a popular research topic for years and has become more or less a practical technology. However, there exists little research on math topic classification. Math documents contain both textual data and math expressions. The text and math can be considered as two related but different views of a math document. The goal of online math topic classification is to automatically categorize a math document containing both mathematical expressions and textual content into an appropriate topic without the need for periodically retraining the classifier. To achieve this, it is essential to have a two-view online classification algorithm, which deals with the textual data view and the math expression view at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive two-view online math document classifier based on the Passive Aggressive (PA) algorithm.

Extension of the rocchio classification method to multi-modal categorization of documents in social media,Amin Mantrach (Yahoo!);Jean-Michel Renders (Yahoo!);,"2027707398,2097538086","Most of the approaches in multi-view categorization use early fusion, late fusion or co-training strategies. We propose here a novel classification method that is able to efficiently capture the interactions across the different modes. This method is a multi-modal extension of the Rocchio classification algorithm --- very popular in the Information Retrieval community. The extension consists of simultaneously maintaining different ""centroid"" representations for each class, in particular ""cross-media"" centroids that correspond to pairs of modes. To classify new data points, different scores are derived from similarity measures between the new data point and these different centroids; a global classification score is finally obtained by suitably aggregating the individual scores. This method outperforms the multi-view logistic regression approach (using either the early fusion or the late fusion strategies) on a social media corpus - namely the ENRON email collection - on two very different categorization tasks (folder classification and recipient prediction).",2012,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

Therefore, in order for individuals to become influential they must not only obtain attention and thus be popular, but also overcome user passivity. We propose an algorithm that determines the influence and passivity of users based on their information forwarding activity.

We explicitly encourage the latent representation to contract the input space by regularizing the norm of the Jacobian (analytically) and the Hessian (stochastically) of the encoder's output with respect to its input, at the training points. While the penalty on the Jacobian's norm ensures robustness to tiny corruption of samples in the input space, constraining the norm of the Hessian extends this robustness when moving further away from the sample. From a manifold learning perspective, balancing this regularization with the auto-encoder's reconstruction objective yields a representation that varies most when moving along the data manifold in input space, and is most insensitive in directions orthogonal to the manifold. The second order regularization, using the Hessian, penalizes curvature, and thus favors smooth manifold.

In the present work we propose to employ ""oblique"" random forests (oRF) built from multivariate trees which explicitly learn optimal split directions at internal nodes using linear discriminative models, rather than using random coefficients as the original oRF. This oRF outperforms RF, as well as other classifiers, on nearly all data sets but those with discrete factorial features. Learned node models perform distinctively better than random splits. An oRF feature importance score shows to be preferable over standard RF feature importance scores such as Gini or permutation importance.

Conventional active learning strategies concentrate on querying the most uncertain instances, which are typically concentrated around the decision boundary. If changes do not occur close to the boundary, they will be missed and classifiers will fail to adapt.

The algorithm builds a language model from a set of pre-tagged binaries using a statistical data compression technique. It sequentially scans a new binary executable and sets a breaking point at each potential code-to-code and code-to-data/data-to-code transition.

Generalized dictionary learning for symmetric positive definite matrices with application to nearest neighbor retrieval,Suvrit Sra (Max Planck Society);Anoop Cherian (University of Minnesota);,"2469620852,2155554263","We introduce Generalized Dictionary Learning (GDL), a simple but practical framework for learning dictionaries over the manifold of positive definite matrices.

DB-CSC: a density-based approach for subspace clustering in graphs with feature vectors,Stephan Günnemann (RWTH Aachen University);Brigitte Boden (RWTH Aachen University);Thomas Seidl (RWTH Aachen University);,"316694267,2117690819,2140301036","Data sources representing attribute information in combination with network information are widely available in today's applications. To realize the full potential for knowledge extraction, mining techniques like clustering should consider both information types simultaneously. Recent clustering approaches combine subspace clustering with dense subgraph mining to identify groups of objects that are similar in subsets of their attributes as well as densely connected within the network. While those approaches successfully circumvent the problem of full-space clustering, their limited cluster definitions are restricted to clusters of certain shapes. In this work, we introduce a density-based cluster definition taking the attribute similarity in subspaces and the graph density into account. This novel cluster model enables us to detect clusters of arbitrary shape and size. We avoid redundancy in the result by selecting only the most interesting non-redundant clusters.

Efficient mining of top correlated patterns based on null-invariant measures,Sangkyum Kim (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign);Marina Barsky (Simon Fraser University);Jiawei Han (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign);,"2164604393,2465269055,2121939561","Mining strong correlations from transactional databases often leads to more meaningful results than mining association rules. In such mining, null (transaction)-invariance is an important property of the correlation measures. Unfortunately, some useful null-invariant measures such as Kulczynski and Cosine, which can discover correlations even for the very unbalanced cases, lack the (anti)-monotonicity property. Thus, they could only be applied to frequent itemsets as the post-evaluation step. For large datasets and for low supports, this approach is computationally prohibitive. This paper presents new properties for all known null-invariant measures. Based on these properties, we develop efficient pruning techniques and design the Apriori-like algorithm NICOMINER for mining strongly correlated patterns directly. We develop both the threshold-bounded and the top-k variations of the algorithm, where top-k is used when the optimal correlation threshold is not known in advance and to give user control over the output size. We test NICOMINER on real-life datasets from different application domains, using Cosine as an example of the null-invariant correlation measure. We show that NICOMINER outperforms support-based approach more than an order of magnitude, and that it is very useful for discovering top correlations in itemsets with low support.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;mathematics;

This paper investigates a simulatorfree direct policy learning, called Preference-based Policy Learning (PPL). PPL iterates a four-step process: the robot demonstrates a candidate policy; the expert ranks this policy comparatively to other ones according to her preferences; these preferences are used to learn a policy return estimate; the robot uses the policy return estimate to build new candidate policies, and the process is iterated until the desired behavior is obtained. PPL requires a good representation of the policy search space be available, enabling one to learn accurate policy return estimates and limiting the human ranking effort needed to yield a good policy. Furthermore, this representation cannot use informed features (e.g., how far the robot is from any target) due to the simulator-free setting. As a second contribution, this paper proposes a representation based on the agnostic exploitation of the robotic log. The convergence of PPL is analytically studied and its experimental validation on two problems, involving a single robot in a maze and two interacting robots, is presented.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

Conventional multi-label learning approaches focus on exploiting the label correlations to improve the accuracy of the learner by building an individual multi-label learner or a combined learner based upon a group of single-label learners. However, the generalization ability of such individual learner can be weak. It is well known that ensemble learning can effectively improve the generalization ability of learning systems by constructing multiple base learners and the performance of an ensemble is related to the both accuracy and diversity of base learners. In this paper, we study the problem of multilabel ensemble learning.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on boosting to address these problems. The proposed algorithm builds base classifiers independently from each data type (view) that provides a partial view about an object of interest. Different from AdaBoost, where each view has its own re-sampling weight, our algorithm uses a single re-sampling distribution for all views at each boosting round. This distribution is determined by the view whose training error is minimal. This shared sampling mechanism restricts noise to individual views, thereby reducing sensitivity to noise. Furthermore, in order to establish performance guarantees, we introduce a randomized version of the algorithm, where a winning view is chosen probabilistically. As a result, it can be cast within a multi-armed bandit framework, which allows us to show that with high probability the algorithm seeks out most discriminant views of data for making predictions.

While the incorporation of monotonicity constraints is rather simple for certain types of models, it may become a more intricate problem for others. By trend, the difficulty of ensuring monotonicity increases with the flexibility or, say, nonlinearity of a model. In this paper, we advocate the so-called Choquet integral as a tool for learning monotone nonlinear models. While being widely used as a flexible aggregation operator in different fields, such as multiple criteria decision making, the Choquet integral is much less known in machine learning so far. Apart from combining monotonicity and flexibility in a mathematically sound and elegant manner, the Choquet integral has additional features making it attractive from a machine learning point of view. Notably, it offers measures for quantifying the importance of individual predictor variables and the interaction between groups of variables. As a concrete application of the Choquet integral, we propose a generalization of logistic regression.

We explicitly encourage the latent representation to contract the input space by regularizing the norm of the Jacobian (analytically) and the Hessian (stochastically) of the encoder's output with respect to its input, at the training points. While the penalty on the Jacobian's norm ensures robustness to tiny corruption of samples in the input space, constraining the norm of the Hessian extends this robustness when moving further away from the sample. From a manifold learning perspective, balancing this regularization with the auto-encoder's reconstruction objective yields a representation that varies most when moving along the data manifold in input space, and is most insensitive in directions orthogonal to the manifold. The second order regularization, using the Hessian, penalizes curvature, and thus favors smooth manifold.

In the present work we propose to employ ""oblique"" random forests (oRF) built from multivariate trees which explicitly learn optimal split directions at internal nodes using linear discriminative models, rather than using random coefficients as the original oRF. This oRF outperforms RF, as well as other classifiers, on nearly all data sets but those with discrete factorial features. Learned node models perform distinctively better than random splits. An oRF feature importance score shows to be preferable over standard RF feature importance scores such as Gini or permutation importance.

This paper presents a machine learning-based disassembly algorithm that segments an x86 binary into subsequences of bytes and then classifies each subsequence as code or data. The algorithm builds a language model from a set of pre-tagged binaries using a statistical data compression technique. It sequentially scans a new binary executable and sets a breaking point at each potential code-to-code and code-to-data/data-to-code transition. The classification of each segment as code or data is based on the minimum cross-entropy. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,segmentation;biological classification;theoretical computer science;data mining;real time computing;machine learning;computer science;
Generalized dictionary learning for symmetric positive definite matrices with application to nearest neighbor retrieval,Suvrit Sra (Max Planck Society);Anoop Cherian (University of Minnesota);,"2469620852,2155554263","We introduce Generalized Dictionary Learning (GDL), a simple but practical framework for learning dictionaries over the manifold of positive definite matrices. We illustrate GDL by applying it to Nearest Neighbor (NN) retrieval, a task of fundamental importance in disciplines such as machine learning and computer vision. GDL distinguishes itself from traditional dictionary learning approaches by explicitly taking into account the manifold structure of the data. In particular, GDL allows performing ""sparse coding"" of positive definite matrices, which enables better NN retrieval.

DB-CSC: a density-based approach for subspace clustering in graphs with feature vectors,Stephan Günnemann (RWTH Aachen University);Brigitte Boden (RWTH Aachen University);Thomas Seidl (RWTH Aachen University);,"316694267,2117690819,2140301036","Data sources representing attribute information in combination with network information are widely available in today's applications. To realize the full potential for knowledge extraction, mining techniques like clustering should consider both information types simultaneously. Recent clustering approaches combine subspace clustering with dense subgraph mining to identify groups of objects that are similar in subsets of their attributes as well as densely connected within the network. While those approaches successfully circumvent the problem of full-space clustering, their limited cluster definitions are restricted to clusters of certain shapes. In this work, we introduce a density-based cluster definition taking the attribute similarity in subspaces and the graph density into account. This novel cluster model enables us to detect clusters of arbitrary shape and size. We avoid redundancy in the result by selecting only the most interesting non-redundant clusters.

Efficient mining of top correlated patterns based on null-invariant measures,Sangkyum Kim (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign);Marina Barsky (Simon Fraser University);Jiawei Han (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign);,"2164604393,2465269055,2121939561","Mining strong correlations from transactional databases often leads to more meaningful results than mining association rules. In such mining, null (transaction)-invariance is an important property of the correlation measures. Unfortunately, some useful null-invariant measures such as Kulczynski and Cosine, which can discover correlations even for the very unbalanced cases, lack the (anti)-monotonicity property. Thus, they could only be applied to frequent itemsets as the post-evaluation step. For large datasets and for low supports, this approach is computationally prohibitive. This paper presents new properties for all known null-invariant measures. Based on these properties, we develop efficient pruning techniques and design the Apriori-like algorithm NICOMINER for mining strongly correlated patterns directly. We develop both the threshold-bounded and the top-k variations of the algorithm, where top-k is used when the optimal correlation threshold is not known in advance and to give user control over the output size. We test NICOMINER on real-life datasets from different application domains, using Cosine as an example of the null-invariant correlation measure. We show that NICOMINER outperforms support-based approach more than an order of magnitude, and that it is very useful for discovering top correlations in itemsets with low support.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;mathematics;

We want to predict the achieved quality for each stick before it reaches the final production station and quality control, in order to save resources.

This paper investigates a simulatorfree direct policy learning, called Preference-based Policy Learning (PPL). PPL iterates a four-step process: the robot demonstrates a candidate policy; the expert ranks this policy comparatively to other ones according to her preferences; these preferences are used to learn a policy return estimate; the robot uses the policy return estimate to build new candidate policies, and the process is iterated until the desired behavior is obtained. PPL requires a good representation of the policy search space be available, enabling one to learn accurate policy return estimates and limiting the human ranking effort needed to yield a good policy. Furthermore, this representation cannot use informed features (e.g., how far the robot is from any target) due to the simulator-free setting. As a second contribution, this paper proposes a representation based on the agnostic exploitation of the robotic log. The convergence of PPL is analytically studied and its experimental validation on two problems, involving a single robot in a maze and two interacting robots, is presented.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

Conventional multi-label learning approaches focus on exploiting the label correlations to improve the accuracy of the learner by building an individual multi-label learner or a combined learner based upon a group of single-label learners. However, the generalization ability of such individual learner can be weak. It is well known that ensemble learning can effectively improve the generalization ability of learning systems by constructing multiple base learners and the performance of an ensemble is related to the both accuracy and diversity of base learners. In this paper, we study the problem of multilabel ensemble learning.

The proposed algorithm builds base classifiers independently from each data type (view) that provides a partial view about an object of interest. Different from AdaBoost, where each view has its own re-sampling weight, our algorithm uses a single re-sampling distribution for all views at each boosting round. This distribution is determined by the view whose training error is minimal. This shared sampling mechanism restricts noise to individual views, thereby reducing sensitivity to noise. Furthermore, in order to establish performance guarantees, we introduce a randomized version of the algorithm, where a winning view is chosen probabilistically. As a result, it can be cast within a multi-armed bandit framework, which allows us to show that with high probability the algorithm seeks out most discriminant views of data for making predictions.

While the incorporation of monotonicity constraints is rather simple for certain types of models, it may become a more intricate problem for others. By trend, the difficulty of ensuring monotonicity increases with the flexibility or, say, nonlinearity of a model. In this paper, we advocate the so-called Choquet integral as a tool for learning monotone nonlinear models. While being widely used as a flexible aggregation operator in different fields, such as multiple criteria decision making, the Choquet integral is much less known in machine learning so far. Apart from combining monotonicity and flexibility in a mathematically sound and elegant manner, the Choquet integral has additional features making it attractive from a machine learning point of view. Notably, it offers measures for quantifying the importance of individual predictor variables and the interaction between groups of variables. As a concrete application of the Choquet integral, we propose a generalization of logistic regression.

In particular, stochastic optimization of the variational Bayes (VB) objective function with a natural gradient step was proved to converge and able to process massive document collections. To reduce noise in the gradient estimation, it considers multiple documents chosen uniformly at random. While it is widely recognized that the scheduling of documents in stochastic optimization may have significant consequences, this issue remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address this issue. Specifically, we propose residual LDA, a novel, easy-to-implement, LDA approach that schedules documents in an informed way. Intuitively, in each iteration, residual LDA actively selects documents that exert a disproportionately large influence on the current residual to compute the next update. On several real-world datasets, including 3M articles from Wikipedia, we demonstrate that residual LDA can handily analyze massive document collections and find topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB and randomly scheduled VB, and significantly faster.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

Several particular formulations for modeling groupwise sparsity have received substantial attention in the literature; and in some cases, efficient algorithms are also available. Surprisingly, for constrained formulations of fundamental importance (e.g., regression with an l1,∞-norm constraint), highly scalable methods seem to be missing. We address this deficiency by presenting a method based on spectral projected-gradient (SPG) that can tackle l1,q -constrained convex regression problems.

We present several numerical results which show that our methods attain up to 30X speedups on large l1,∞-multitask lasso problems.

An important motivation for a ""preference-based"" approach to reinforcement learning is a possible extension of the type of feedback an agent may learn from. In particular, while conventional RL methods are essentially confined to deal with numerical rewards, there are many applications in which this type of information is not naturally available, and in which only qualitative reward signals are provided instead. Therefore, building on novel methods for preference learning, our general goal is to equip the RL agent with qualitative policy models, such as ranking functions that allow for sorting its available actions from most to least promising, as well as algorithms for learning such models from qualitative feedback. Concretely, in this paper, we build on an existing method for approximate policy iteration based on roll-outs.

Producing these labeled training sets is usually very costly as it requires human annotators to assess the relevance or order the elements in the training set. Recently, active learning alternatives have been proposed to reduce the labeling effort by selectively sampling an unlabeled set. In this paper we propose a novel rule-based active sampling method for Learning to Rank. Our method actively samples an unlabeled set, selecting new documents to be labeled based on how many relevance inference rules they generate given the previously selected and labeled examples. The smaller the number of generated rules, the more dissimilar and more ""informative"" is a document with regard to the current state of the labeled set. Differently from previous solutions, our algorithm does not rely on an initial training seed and can be directly applied to an unlabeled dataset. Also in contrast to previous work, we have a clear stop criterion and do not need to empirically discover the best configuration by running a number of iterations on the validation or test sets. These characteristics make our algorithm highly practical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our active sampling method on several benchmarking datasets, showing that a significant reduction in training size is possible.

This causes top-k mining algorithms to return highly redundant result sets, while ignoring many potentially interesting results. These problems are particularly apparent with Subgroup Discovery and its generalisation, Exceptional Model Mining. To address this, we introduce subgroup set mining: one should not consider individual subgroups, but sets of subgroups. We consider three degrees of redundancy, and propose corresponding heuristic selection strategies in order to eliminate redundancy. By incorporating these strategies in a beam search, the balance between exploration and exploitation is improved. Experiments clearly show that the proposed methods result in much more diverse subgroup sets than traditional Subgroup Discovery methods.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,combinatorics;data mining;algorithm;mathematics;
Abductive plan recognition by extending Bayesian logic programs,Sindhu Raghavan (University of Texas at Austin);Raymond J. Mooney (University of Texas at Austin);,"2101576581,2167433806","Plan recognition is the task of predicting an agent's top-level plans based on its observed actions. It is an abductive reasoning task that involves inferring cause from effect. Most existing approaches to plan recognition use either first-order logic or probabilistic graphical models. While the former cannot handle uncertainty, the latter cannot handle structured representations. In order to overcome these limitations, we develop an approach to plan recognition using Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs), which combine first-order logic and Bayesian networks. Since BLPs employ logical deduction to construct the networks, they cannot be used effectively for plan recognition. Therefore, we extend BLPs to use logical abduction to construct Bayesian networks and call the resulting model Bayesian Abductive Logic Programs (BALPs). We learn the parameters in BALPs using the Expectation Maximization algorithm adapted for BLPs. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of BALPs on three benchmark data sets and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art for plan recognition.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,abductive logic programming;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

Fast and memory-efficient discovery of the top-k relevant subgroups in a reduced candidate space,Henrik Grosskreutz (Fraunhofer Society);Daniel Paurat (Fraunhofer Society);,"290692522,717148855","We consider a modified version of the top-k subgroup discovery task, where subgroups dominated by other subgroups are discarded. The advantage of this modified task, known as relevant subgroup discovery, is that it avoids redundancy in the outcome. Although it has been applied in many applications, so far no efficient exact algorithm for this task has been proposed. Most existing solutions do not guarantee the exact solution (as a result of the use of non-admissible heuristics), while the only exact solution relies on the explicit storage of the whole search space, which results in prohibitively large memory requirements. In this paper, we present a new top-k relevant subgroup discovery algorithm which overcomes these shortcomings. Our solution is based on the fact that if an iterative deepening approach is applied, the relevance check - which is the root of the problems of all other approaches - can be realized based solely on the best k subgroups visited so far. The approach also allows for the integration of admissible pruning techniques like optimistic estimate pruning. The result is a fast, memory-efficient algorithm which clearly outperforms existing top-k relevant subgroup discovery approaches. Moreover, we analytically and empirically show that it is competitive with simpler approaches which do not consider the relevance criterion.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,discrete mathematics;combinatorics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;

Feature selection for transfer learning,Selen Uguroglu (Language Technologies Institute);Jaime G. Carbonell (Language Technologies Institute);,"2512693847,2100444261","Common assumption in most machine learning algorithms is that, labeled (source) data and unlabeled (target) data are sampled from the same distribution. However, many real world tasks violate this assumption: in temporal domains, feature distributions may vary over time, clinical studies may have sampling bias, or sometimes sufficient labeled data for the domain of interest does not exist, and labeled data from a related domain must be utilized. In such settings, knowing in which dimensions source and target data vary is extremely important to reduce the distance between domains and accurately transfer knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel method to identify variant and invariant features between two datasets. Our contribution is two fold: First, we present a novel transfer learning approach for domain adaptation, and second, we formalize the problem of finding differently distributed features as a convex optimization problem.

The classification problem is modeled as a sequential decision process that sequentially chooses, for each datapoint, which features to use before classifying.

The major theoretical contribution of this work, which is of independent interest, is an explicit bound on the VC-dimension of a range space defined by all possible outcomes of a collection (class) of queries. We prove that the VC-dimension is a function of the maximum number of Boolean operations in the selection predicate, and of the maximum number of select and join operations in any individual query in the collection, but it is neither a function of the number of queries in the collection nor of the size of the database. We develop a method based on this result: given a class of queries, it constructs a concise random sample of a database, such that with high probability the execution of any query in the class on the sample provides an accurate estimate for the selectivity of the query on the original large database. The error probability holds simultaneously for the selectivity estimates of all queries in the collection, thus the same sample can be used to evaluate the selectivity of multiple queries, and the sample needs to be refreshed only following major changes in the database. The sample representation computed by our method is typically sufficiently small to be stored in main memory. We present extensive experimental results, validating our theoretical analysis and demonstrating the advantage of our technique when compared to complex selectivity estimation techniques used in PostgreSQL and the Microsoft SQL Server.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,conjunctive query;spatial query;view;vc dimension;data structure;theoretical computer science;data mining;database;machine learning;programming language;statistics;computer science;
COSNet: a cost sensitive neural network for semi-supervised learning in graphs,Alberto Bertoni (University of Milan);Marco Frasca (University of Milan);Giorgio Valentini (University of Milan);,"2015157942,2177740477,2141756282","The semi-supervised problem of learning node labels in graphs consists, given a partial graph labeling, in inferring the unknown labels of the unlabeled vertices. Several machine learning algorithms have been proposed for solving this problem, including Hopfield networks and label propagation methods; however, some issues have been only partially considered, e.g. the preservation of the prior knowledge and the unbalance between positive and negative labels. To address these items, we propose a Hopfield-based cost sensitive neural network algorithm (COSNet). The method factorizes the solution of the problem in two parts: 1) the subnetwork composed by the labelled vertices is considered, and the network parameters are estimated through a supervised algorithm; 2) the estimated parameters are extended to the subnetwork composed of the unlabeled vertices, and the attractor reached by the dynamics of this subnetwork allows to predict the labeling of the unlabeled vertices. The proposed method embeds in the neural algorithm the ""a priori"" knowledge coded in the labelled part of the graph, and separates node labels and neuron states, allowing to differentially weight positive and negative node labels. Moreover, COSNet introduces an efficient costsensitive strategy which allows to learn the near-optimal parameters of the network in order to take into account the unbalance between positive and negative node labels. Finally, the dynamics of the network is restricted to its unlabeled part, preserving the minimization of the overall objective function and significantly reducing the time complexity of the learning algorithm. COSNet has been applied to the genome-wide prediction of gene function in a model organism.

A game theoretic framework for data privacy preservation in recommender systems,Maria Halkidi (University of Piraeus);Iordanis Koutsopoulos (University of Thessaly);,"339332626,436372673","We address the fundamental tradeoff between privacy preservation and high-quality recommendation stemming from a third party. Multiple users submit their ratings to a third party about items they have viewed. The third party aggregates the ratings and generates personalized recommendations for each user. The quality of recommendations for each user depends on submitted rating profiles from all users, including the user to which the recommendation is destined. Each user would like to declare a rating profile so as to preserve data privacy as much as possible, while not causing deterioration in the quality of the recommendation he would get, compared to the one he would get if he revealed his true private profile. We employ game theory to model and study the interaction of users and we derive conditions and expressions for the Nash Equilibrium Point (NEP). This consists of the rating strategy of each user, such that no user can benefit in terms of improving its privacy by unilaterally deviating from that point. User strategies converge to the NEP after an iterative best-response strategy update. For a hybrid recommendation system, we find that the NEP strategy for each user in terms of privacy preservation is to declare false rating only for one item, the one that is highly ranked in his private profile and less correlated with items for which he anticipates recommendation. We also present various modes of cooperation by which users can mutually benefit.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,game theory;internet privacy;world wide web;data mining;computer science;

Given a text corpus, we want to test a hypothesis, such as ""word X is frequent"", ""word X has become more frequent over time"", or ""word X is more frequent in male than in female speech"". For this purpose we need a null model of word frequencies. The commonly used bag-of-words model, which corresponds to a Bernoulli process with fixed parameter, does not account for any structure present in natural languages. Using this model for word frequencies results in large numbers of words being reported as unexpectedly frequent. We address how to take into account the inherent occurrence patterns of words in significance testing of word frequencies. Based on studies of words in two large corpora, we propose two methods for modeling word frequencies that both take into account the occurrence patterns of words and go beyond the bag-of-words assumption. The first method models word frequencies based on the spatial distribution of individual words in the language. The second method is based on bootstrapping and takes into account only word frequency at the text level. The proposed methods are compared to the current gold standard in a series of experiments on both corpora.

In many applications, including those involving interactions between multiple agents (e.g., humans and robots), sources of uncertainty affect rewards and transition dynamics in such a way that a Markovian representation would be computationally very expensive. An alternative formulation of the decision problem involves partially specified behaviors with choice points. While this reduces the complexity of the policy space that must be explored - something that is crucial for realistic autonomous agents that must bound search time - it does render the domain Non-Markovian. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for reinforcement learning in Non-Markovian domains. Our algorithm, Stochastic Search Monte Carlo, performs a global stochastic search in policy space, shaping the distribution from which the next policy is selected by estimating an upper bound on the value of each action.

Then the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation of the hidden true labels and the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of quality of multiple annotators are provided alternately. Experiments on emotional speech classification and CASP9 protein disorder prediction tasks show performance improvement of the proposed approach as compared to the majority voting baseline and a previous data-independent approach.

To address the above limitations, in this paper, we develop iDVS, a visualization-enabled multi-document summarization system with users' interaction, to improve the summarization performance using users' feedback and to assist users in document understanding using visualization techniques. In particular, iDVS uses a new semi-supervised document summarization method to dynamically select sentences based on users' interaction.

A shapley value approach for influence attribution,Panagiotis Papapetrou (Aalto University);Aristides Gionis (Yahoo!);Heikki Mannila (Aalto University);,"2000108749,737311942,310734946","Finding who and what is ""important"" is an ever-occurring question. Many methods that aim at characterizing important items or influential individuals have been developed in areas such as, bibliometrics, social-network analysis, link analysis, and web search. In this paper we study the problem of attributing influence scores to individuals who accomplish tasks in a collaborative manner. We assume that individuals build small teams, in different and diverse ways, in order to accomplish atomic tasks. For each task we are given an assessment of success or importance score, and the goal is to attribute those team-wise scores to the individuals. The challenge we face is that individuals in strong coalitions are favored against individuals in weaker coalitions, so the objective is to find fair attributions that account for such biasing. We propose an iterative algorithm for solving this problem that is based on the concept of Shapley value. The proposed method is applicable to a variety of scenarios, for example, attributing influence scores to scientists who collaborate in published articles, or employees of a company who participate in projects. Our method is evaluated on two real datasets: ISI Web of Science publication data and the Internet Movie Database.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,shapley value;knowledge management;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;
Sampling table configurations for the hierarchical poisson-dirichlet process,Changyou Chen (Australian National University);Lan Du (Australian National University);Wray L. Buntine (Australian National University);,"2156460610,2150389075,2282891647","Hierarchical modeling and reasoning are fundamental in machine intelligence, and for this the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet Process (PDP) plays an important role. The most popular MCMC sampling algorithm for the hierarchical PDP and hierarchical Dirichlet Process is to conduct an incremental sampling based on the Chinese restaurant metaphor, which originates from the Chinese restaurant process (CRP). In this paper, with the same metaphor, we propose a new table representation for the hierarchical PDPs by introducing an auxiliary latent variable, called table indicator, to record which customer takes responsibility for starting a new table. In this way, the new representation allows full exchangeability that is an essential condition for a correct Gibbs sampling algorithm. Based on this representation, we develop a block Gibbs sampling algorithm, which can jointly sample the data item and its table contribution. We test this out on the hierarchical Dirichlet process variant of latent Dirichlet allocation (HDP-LDA) developed by Teh, Jordan, Beal and Blei. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms their ""posterior sampling by direct assignment"" algorithm in both out-of-sample perplexity and convergence speed.

An important question is the learning of models upon the primary objects (patients, customers) rather than the transactions, especially when these models are subjected to drift. We address this problem by combining advances of online clustering on multivariate data with the trajectory mining paradigm. We model the measurements of each individual primary object (e.g. its transactions), taken at irregular time intervals, as a trajectory in a high-dimensional feature space. Then, we cluster individuals with similar trajectories to identify sub-populations that evolve similarly, e.g. groups of customers that evolve similarly or groups of employees that have similar careers. We assume that the multivariate trajectories are generated by drifting Gaussian Mixture Models. We study (i) an EM-based approach that clusters these trajectories incrementally as a reference method that has access to all the data for learning, and propose (ii) an online algorithm based on a Kalman filter that efficiently tracks the trajectories of Gaussian clusters. We show that while both methods approximate the reference well, the algorithm based on a Kalman filter is faster by one order of magnitude compared to the EM-based approach.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,k medians clustering;correlation clustering;data stream clustering;fuzzy clustering;cluster analysis;data science;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

However, these methods offer no theoretical guarantee as to the gener- alization performance and discriminative power of the resulting similari- ties.

In literature, a great deal of research work has been devoted to the development of algorithms performing this task. Often, these techniques require as parameter the number of dimensions to be retained; to this aim, they need to estimate the ""intrinsic dimensionality"" of the given dataset, which refers to the minimum number of degrees of freedom needed to capture all the information carried by the data. Although many estimation techniques have been proposed, most of them fail in case of noisy data or when the intrinsic dimensionality is too high.

A boosting approach to multiview classification with cooperation,Sokol Koço (Centre national de la recherche scientifique);Cécile Capponi (Centre national de la recherche scientifique);,"2509383775,2514649033","In many fields, such as bioinformatics or multimedia, data may be described using different sets of features (or views) which carry either global or local information. Some learning tasks make use of these several views in order to improve overall predictive power of classifiers through fusion-based methods. Usually, these approaches rely on a weighted combination of classifiers (or selected descriptions), where classifiers are learned independently. One drawback of these methods is that the classifier learned on one view does not communicate its failures within the other views. This paper deals with a novel approach to integrate multiview information. The proposed algorithm, named Mumbo, is based on boosting. Within the boosting scheme, Mumbo maintains one distribution of examples on each view, and at each round, it learns one weak classifier on each view. Within a view, the distribution of examples evolves both with the ability of the dedicated classifier to deal with examples of the corresponding features space, and with the ability of classifiers in other views to process the same examples within their own description spaces. Hence, the principle is to slightly remove the hard examples from the learning space of one view, while their weights get higher in the other views. This way, we expect that examples are urged to be processed by the most appropriate views, when possible. At the end of the iterative learning process, a final classifier is computed by a weighted combination of selected weak classifiers. This paper provides the Mumbo algorithm in a multiclass and multiview setting, based on recent theoretical advances in boosting. The boosting properties of Mumbo are proved, as well as some results on its generalization capabilities. Several experimental results are reported which point out that complementary views may actually cooperate under some assumptions.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,boosting methods for object categorization;boosting;biological classification;supervised learning;data mining;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

MKL has become a preferred choice for information fusion in object recognition. However, in the case of highly discriminative and complementary feature channels, it does not significantly improve upon its trivial baseline which averages the kernels. Alternative ways are stacking and classifier level fusion (CLF) which rely on a two phase approach. There is a significant amount of work on linear programming formulations of ensemble methods particularly in the case of binary classification. In this paper we propose a multiclass extension of binary v-LPBoost, which learns the contribution of each class in each feature channel. The existing approaches of classifier fusion promote sparse features combinations, due to regularization based on l1-norm, and lead to a selection of a subset of feature channels, which is not good in the case of informative channels. Therefore, we generalize existing classifier fusion formulations to arbitrary lp-norm for binary and multiclass problems which results in more effective use of complementary information. We also extended stacking for both binary and multiclass datasets. We present an extensive evaluation of the fusion methods on four datasets involving kernels that are all informative and achieve state-of-the-art results on all of them.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;mathematics;

Sparsity is achieved by a novel matching pursuit approach that can be applied to other tasks as well.

Experiments show that the influence maximization problem is sensitive to the model parameters under the linear threshold model. In the sequel, we formally define the problem of finding the model parameters for influence maximization as an active learning problem under the linear threshold model.

Network regression with predictive clustering trees,Daniela Stojanova;Michelangelo Ceci (University of Bari);Annalisa Appice (University of Bari);Sašo Džeroski (University of Freiburg);,"2037620856,2114873949,135896968,1419022840","Regression inference in network data is a challenging task in machine learning and data mining. Network data describe entities represented by nodes, which may be connected with (related to) each other by edges. Many network datasets are characterized by a form of autocorrelation where the values of the response variable at a given node depend on the values of the variables (predictor and response) at the nodes connected to the given node. This phenomenon is a direct violation of the assumption of independent (i.i.d.) observations: At the same time, it offers a unique opportunity to improve the performance of predictive models on network data, as inferences about one entity can be used to improve inferences about related entities. In this paper, we propose a data mining method that explicitly considers autocorrelation when building regression models from network data. The method is based on the concept of predictive clustering trees (PCTs), which can be used both for clustering and predictive tasks: PCTs are decision trees viewed as hierarchies of clusters and provide symbolic descriptions of the clusters. In addition, PCTs can be used for multi-objective prediction problems, including multi-target regression and multi-target classification. Empirical results on real world problems of network regression show that the proposed extension of PCTs performs better than traditional decision tree induction when autocorrelation is present in the data.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,autocorrelation;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

A novel framework for locating software faults using latent divergences,Shounak Roychowdhury (University of Texas at Austin);Sarfraz Khurshid (University of Texas at Austin);,"2305433315,2103685797","Fault localization, i.e., identifying erroneous lines of code in a buggy program, is a tedious process, which often requires considerable manual effort and is costly. Recent years have seen much progress in techniques for automated fault localization, specifically using program spectra - executions of failed and passed test runs provide a basis for isolating the faults. Despite the progress, fault localization in large programs remains a challenging problem, because even inspecting a small fraction of the lines of code in a large problem can require substantial manual effort. This paper presents a novel framework for fault localization based on latent divergences - an effective method for feature selection in machine learning. Our insight is that the problem of fault localization can be reduced to the problem of feature selection, where lines of code correspond to features.

Discovering temporal bisociations for linking concepts over time,Corrado Loglisci (University of Bari);Michelangelo Ceci (University of Bari);,"1223682277,2114873949","Bisociations represent interesting relationships between seemingly unconnected concepts from two or more contexts. Most of the existing approaches that permit the discovery of bisociations from data rely on the assumption that contexts are static or considered as unchangeable domains. Actually, several real-world domains are intrinsically dynamic and can change over time. The same domain can change and can become completely different from what/how it was before: a dynamic domain observed at different time-points can present different representations and can be reasonably assimilated to a series of distinct static domains. In this work, we investigate the task of linking concepts from a dynamic domain through the discovery of bisociations which link concepts over time. This provides us with a means to unearth linkages which have not been discovered when observing the domain as static, but which may have developed over time, when considering the dynamic nature. We propose a computational solution which, assuming a time interval-based discretization of the domain, explores the spaces of association rules mined in the intervals and chains the rules on the basis of the concept generalization and information theory criteria.

However, when data arrive sequentially and in large quantities, both computation and storage limitations become a bottleneck. In this paper, we present a new semisupervised coarse graining (CG) algorithm to reduce the required number of data points for preserving the manifold structure. First, an equivalent formulation of Label Propagation (LP) is derived. Then a novel spectral view of the Harmonic Solution (HS) is proposed. Finally an algorithm to reduce the number of data points while preserving the manifold structure is provided and a theoretical analysis on preservation of the LP properties is presented. Experimental results on real world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art coarse graining algorithm in different settings.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,manifold alignment;semi supervised learning;theoretical computer science;combinatorics;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

Frequency-aware truncated methods for sparse online learning,Hidekazu Oiwa (University of Tokyo);Shin Matsushima (University of Tokyo);Hiroshi Nakagawa (University of Tokyo);,"2158253856,2153313846,2094248864","Online supervised learning with L1-regularization has gained attention recently because it generally requires less computational time and a smaller space of complexity than batch-type learning methods. However, a simple L1-regularization method used in an online setting has the side effect that rare features tend to be truncated more than necessary. In fact, feature frequency is highly skewed in many applications. We developed a new family of L1-regularization methods based on the previous updates for loss minimization in linear online learning settings. Our methods can identify and retain low-frequency occurrence but informative features at the same computational cost and convergence rate as previous works. Moreover, we combined our methods with a cumulative penalty model to derive more robust models over noisy data. We applied our methods to several datasets and empirically evaluated the performance of our algorithms. Experimental results showed that our frequency-aware truncated models improved the prediction accuracy.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,online machine learning;regularization;semi supervised learning;convex optimization;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

An exact dynamic programming algorithm to compute the respective posterior probabilities is developed, under the complete data assumption. Our experimental results show that ancestor relations between observed variables, arcs in particular, can be learned with good power even when a majority of the involved variables are unobserved. For comparison, deduction of ancestor relations from single maximum a posteriori network structures or their Markov equivalence class appears somewhat inferior to Bayesian averaging.

Eigenvector sensitive feature selection for spectral clustering,Yi Jiang (Sun Yat-sen University);Jiangtao Ren (Sun Yat-sen University);,"2610289431,2170114694","Spectral clustering is one of the most popular methods for data clustering, and its performance is determined by the quality of the eigenvectors of the related graph Laplacian. Generally, graph Laplacian is constructed using the full features, which will degrade the quality of the related eigenvectors when there are a large number of noisy or irrelevant features in datasets. To solve this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised feature selection method inspired by perturbation analysis theory, which discusses the relationship between the perturbation of the eigenvectors of a matrix and its elements' perturbation. We evaluate the importance of each feature based on the average L1 norm of the perturbation of the first k eigenvectors of graph Laplacian corresponding to the k smallest positive eigenvalues, with respect to the feature's perturbation.

Comparing apples and oranges: measuring differences between data mining results,Nikolaj Tatti (University of Antwerp);Jilles Vreeken (University of Antwerp);,"1367500519,1971070670","Deciding whether the results of two different mining algorithms provide significantly different information is an important open problem in exploratory data mining. Whether the goal is to select the most informative result for analysis, or decide which mining approach will likely provide the most novel insight, it is essential that we can tell how different the information is that two results provide. In this paper we take a first step towards comparing exploratory results on binary data. We propose to meaningfully convert results into sets of noisy tiles, and compare between these sets byMaximum Entropy modelling and Kullback-Leibler divergence. The measure we construct this way is flexible, and allows us to naturally include background knowledge, such that differences in results can be measured from the perspective of what a user already knows. Furthermore, adding to its interpretability, it coincides with Jaccard dissimilarity when we only consider exact tiles. Our approach provides a means to study and tell differences between results of different data mining methods. As an application, we show that it can also be used to identify which parts of results best redescribe other results. Experimental evaluation shows our measure gives meaningful results, correctly identifies methods that are similar in nature, and automatically provides sound redescriptions of results.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data science;data mining;machine learning;mathematics;

Unlike traditional methods, we measure the similarities among tasks from the macro level perspective through minimum encoding. Particularly speaking, the degree of the similarity is represented by the relevant code length of the class boundary of each source task with respect to the target task. In addition, informative parts of the source tasks are adaptively selected in the micro level viewpoint to make the choice of the specific source task more accurate.

We show that these measures are not necessarily suitable for application in the more typical fixed experts' group scenario.

We propose an information-theoretic approach, using the Jensen-Shannon divergence to assess this stability (or robustness). Unlike other measures, this new metric is suitable for different algorithm outcomes: full ranked lists, partial sublists (top-k lists) as well as the least studied partial ranked lists. This generalized metric attempts to measure the disagreement among a whole set of lists with the same size, following a probabilistic approach and being able to give more importance to the differences that appear at the top of the list.

This leads to a convex optimization problem, which is essential for the tractability of the optimization problem arising from the sparse SVM formulation we derived subsequently, as well as the validity of the optimization strategy we employed to solve it. Based on the ""label-mean"" formulation, we can build sparse SVM models for MI classification and explicitly control their sparsities by enforcing the maximum number of expansions allowed in the prediction function. An effective optimization strategy is adopted to solve the formulated sparse learning problem which involves the learning of both the classifier and the expansion vectors. Experimental results on benchmark data sets have demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective in building very sparse SVM models while achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art MI classifiers.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,sparse approximation;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;mathematics;

The idea is to estimate from data the probability that a greedy selection returns the best alternative and to define a sampling rule which maximises such quantity. Analytical results in the case of two alternatives are extended to a larger number of alternatives by using the Clark's approximation of the maximum of a set of random variables.

The implemented algorithm named ShiftTree is compared to the well-known instance-based time series classifier 1-NN using different distance metrics, used over all 20 datasets of a public benchmark time series database and two more public time series datasets. On these benchmark datasets, our experiments show that the new model-based algorithm has an average accuracy slightly better than the most efficient instance-based methods, and there are multiple datasets where our model-based classifier exceeds the accuracy of instance-based methods.

In this article, we apply the theory behind compressive sampling to the document clustering problem using k-means clustering. We provide a method of computing high accuracy clusters in a fraction of the time it would have taken by directly clustering the documents. This is performed by using the Discrete Fourier Transform and the Discrete Cosine Transform. We provide empirical results showing that compressive sampling provides a 14 times increase in speed with little reduction in accuracy on 7,095 documents, and we also provide a very accurate clustering of a 231,219 document set, providing 20 times increase in speed when compared to performing k-means clustering on the document set.

Common substructure learning of multiple graphical Gaussian models,Satoshi Hara (Osaka University);Takashi Washio (Osaka University);,"2421612252,1794038515","Learning underlying mechanisms of data generation is of great interest in the scientific and engineering fields amongst others. Finding dependency structures among variables in the data is one possible approach for the purpose, and is an important task in data mining. In this paper, we focus on learning dependency substructures shared by multiple datasets. In many scenarios, the nature of data varies due to a change in the surrounding conditions or non-stationary mechanisms over the multiple datasets. However, we can also assume that the change occurs only partially and some relations between variables remain unchanged. Moreover, we can expect that such commonness over the multiple datasets is closely related to the invariance of the underlying mechanism. For example, errors in engineering systems are usually caused by faults in the sub-systems with the other parts remaining healthy. In such situations, though anomalies are observed in sensor values, the underlying invariance of the healthy sub-systems is still captured by some steady dependency structures before and after the onset of the error. We propose a structure learning algorithm to find such invariances in the case of Graphical Gaussian Models (GGM). The proposed method is based on a block coordinate descent optimization, where subproblems can be solved efficiently by existing algorithms for Lasso and the continuous quadratic knapsack problem.

In nonlinear filtering problems the posterior state distribution can, however, take complex shapes and even become multimodal so that single Gaussians are no longer sufficient. A standard solution to this problem is to use a bank of independent filters that individually represent the posterior with a single Gaussian and jointly form a mixture of Gaussians representation. Unfortunately, since the filters are optimized separately and interactions between the components consequently not taken into account, the resulting representation is typically poor. As an alternative we therefore propose to directly optimize the full approximating mixture distribution by minimizing the KL divergence to the true state posterior. For this purpose we describe a deterministic sampling approach that allows us to perform the intractable minimization approximately and at reasonable computational cost. We find that the proposed method models multimodal posterior distributions noticeably better than banks of independent filters even when the latter are allowed many more mixture components. We demonstrate the importance of accurately representing the posterior with a tractable number of components in an active learning scenario where we report faster convergence, both in terms of number of observations processed and in terms of computation time, and more reliable convergence on up to ten-dimensional problems.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,machine learning;mathematical optimization;statistics;mathematics;

Constrained logistic regression for discriminative pattern mining,Rajul Anand (Wayne State University);Chandan K. Reddy (Wayne State University);,"2123287104,2100435683","Analyzing differences in multivariate datasets is a challenging problem. This topic was earlier studied by finding changes in the distribution differences either in the form of patterns representing conjunction of attribute value pairs or univariate statistical analysis for each attribute in order to highlight the differences. All such methods focus only on change in attributes in some form and do not implicitly consider the class labels associated with the data. In this paper, we pose the difference in distribution in a supervised scenario where the change in the data distribution is measured in terms of the change in the corresponding classification boundary. We propose a new constrained logistic regression model to measure such a difference between multivariate data distributions based on the predictive models induced on them. Using our constrained models, we measure the difference in the data distributions using the changes in the classification boundary of these models.

Clustering rankings in the fourier domain,Stéphan Clémençon (Télécom ParisTech);Romaric Gaudel (Télécom ParisTech);Jérémie Jakubowicz (Télécom ParisTech);,"2185197020,2487883855,2035620051","It is the purpose of this paper to introduce a novel approach to clustering rank data on a set of possibly large cardinality n ∈ N*, relying upon Fourier representation of functions defined on the symmetric group Sn. In the present setup, covering a wide variety of practical situations, rank data are viewed as distributions on Sn. Cluster analysis aims at segmenting data into homogeneous subgroups, hopefully very dissimilar in a certain sense. Whereas considering dissimilarity measures/distances between distributions on the non commutative group Sn, in a coordinate manner by viewing it as embedded in the set [0, 1]n! for instance, hardly yields interpretable results and leads to face obvious computational issues, evaluating the closeness of groups of permutations in the Fourier domain may be much easier in contrast. Indeed, in a wide variety of situations, a few well-chosen Fourier (matrix) coefficients may permit to approximate efficiently two distributions on Sn as well as their degree of dissimilarity, while describing global properties in an interpretable fashion. Following in the footsteps of recent advances in automatic feature selection in the context of unsupervised learning, we propose to cast the task of clustering rankings in terms of optimization of a criterion that can be expressed in the Fourier domain in a simple manner.

Using these phrases, we find web (Wikipedia) articles that represent the central concepts presented in the section and augment the section with links to them [4]. We also describe a framework for finding images that are most relevant to a section of the textbook, while respectingglobal relevancy to the entire chapter to which the section belongs.

A robust ranking methodology based on diverse calibration of AdaBoost,Róbert Busa-Fekete (University of Paris-Sud);Balázs Kégl (University of Paris-Sud);Tamás Éltetö (University of Paris-Sud);György Szarvas (Hungarian Academy of Sciences);,"169445216,2308666198,2496661395,2311590765","In subset ranking, the goal is to learn a ranking function that approximates a gold standard partial ordering of a set of objects (in our case, relevance labels of a set of documents retrieved for the same query). In this paper we introduce a learning to rank approach to subset ranking based on multi-class classification. Our technique can be summarized in three major steps. First, a multi-class classification model (AdaBoost.MH) is trained to predict the relevance label of each object. Second, the trained model is calibrated using various calibration techniques to obtain diverse class probability estimates. Finally, the Bayes-scoring function (which optimizes the popular Information Retrieval performance measure NDCG), is approximated through mixing these estimates into an ultimate scoring function. An important novelty of our approach is that many different methods are applied to estimate the same probability distribution, and all these hypotheses are combined into an improved model. It is well known that mixing different conditional distributions according to a prior is usually more efficient than selecting one ""optimal"" distribution. Accordingly, using all the calibration techniques, our approach does not require the estimation of the best suited calibration method and is therefore less prone to overfitting. In an experimental study, our method outperformed many standard ranking algorithms on the LETOR benchmark datasets, most of which are based on significantly more complex learning to rank algorithms than ours.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,ranking;ranking svm;adaboost;learning to rank;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

In this work, we are interested in the problem of mining topic-specific influence between academia and industry. More specifically, given a coauthorship network, we want to identify which academia researcher is most influential to a given company on specific research topics.

Although traditional semisupervised learning methods play an important role in network data analysis, they fail to protect such sensitive information. Our solutions enable to predict labels of partially labeled graphs without disclosure of labels and links, by incorporating cryptographic techniques into the label propagation algorithm. Even when labels included in the graph are kept private, the accuracy of our PPLP is equivalent to that of label propagation which is allowed to observe all labels in the graph. Empirical analysis showed that our solution is scalable compared with existing privacy preserving methods. The results with human contact networks showed that our protocol takes only about 10 seconds for computation and no sensitive information is disclosed through the protocol execution.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,semi supervised learning;internet privacy;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Learning first-order definite theories via object-based queries,Joseph Selman (Oregon State University);Alan Fern (Oregon State University);,"2154362648,2139785505","We study the problem of exact learning of first-order definite theories via queries, toward the goal of allowing humans to more efficiently teach first-order concepts to computers. Prior work has shown that first order Horn theories can be learned using a polynomial number of membership and equivalence queries [6]. However, these query types are sometimes unnatural for humans to answer and only capture a small fraction of the information that a human teacher might be able to easily communicate. In this work, we enrich the types of information that can be provided by a human teacher and study the associated learning problem from a theoretical perspective. First, we consider allowing queries that ask the teacher for the relevant objects in a training example. Second, we examine a new query type, called a pairing query, where the teacher provides mappings between objects in two different examples. We present algorithms that leverage these new query types as well as restrictions applied to equivalence queries to significantly reduce or eliminate the required number of membership queries, while preserving polynomial learnability. In addition, we give learnability results for certain cases of imperfect teachers. These results show, in theory, the potential for incorporating object-based queries into first-order learning algorithms in order to reduce human teaching effort.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,spatial query;theoretical computer science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;mathematics;
The minimum code length for clustering using the gray code,Mahito Sugiyama (Kyoto University);Akihiro Yamamoto (Kyoto University);,"2267106725,2144601133","We propose new approaches to exploit compression algorithms for clustering numerical data. Our first contribution is to design a measure that can score the quality of a given clustering result under the light of a fixed encoding scheme. We call this measure the Minimum Code Length (MCL). Our second contribution is to propose a general strategy to translate any encoding method into a cluster algorithm, which we call COOL (COding-Oriented cLustering). COOL has a low computational cost since it scales linearly with the data set size. The clustering results of COOL is also shown to minimize MCL. To illustrate further this approach, we consider the Gray Code as the encoding scheme to present GCOOL. G-COOL can find clusters of arbitrary shapes and remove noise. Moreover, it is robust to change in the input parameters; it requires only two lower bounds for the number of clusters and the size of each cluster, whereas most algorithms for finding arbitrarily shaped clusters work well only if all parameters are tuned appropriately.

A novel stability based feature selection framework for k-means clustering,Dimitrios Mavroeidis (Radboud University Nijmegen);Elena Marchiori (Radboud University Nijmegen);,"2715883754,1974086637","Stability of a learning algorithm with respect to small input perturbations is an important property, as it implies the derived models to be robust with respect to the presence of noisy features and/or data sample fluctuations. In this paper we explore the effect of stability optimization in the standard feature selection process for the continuous (PCA-based) k-means clustering problem. Interestingly, we derive that stability maximization naturally introduces a tradeoff between cluster separation and variance, leading to the selection of features that have a high cluster separation index that is not artificially inflated by the feature's variance. The proposed algorithmic setup is based on a Sparse PCA approach, that selects the features that maximize stability in a greedy fashion. In our study, we also analyze several properties of Sparse PCA relevant to stability that promote Sparse PCA as a viable feature selection mechanism for clustering. The practical relevance of the proposed method is demonstrated in the context of cancer research, where we consider the problem of detecting potential tumor biomarkers using microarray gene expression data. The application of our method to a leukemia dataset shows that the tradeoff between cluster separation and variance leads to the selection of features corresponding to important biomarker genes. Some of them have relative low variance and are not detected without the direct optimization of stability in Sparse PCA based k-means.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,k means clustering;feature selection;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Awareness of the relationship types is very helpful for us to understand the structure and the characteristics of the social network. Traditional classifiers are not accurate enough for relationship labeling since they assume that all the labels are independent and identically distributed. A relational probabilistic model, relational Markov networks (RMNs), is introduced to labeling relationships, but the inefficient parameter estimation makes it difficult to deploy in large-scale social networks. In this paper, we propose a communitybased pseudolikelihood (CBPL) approach for relationship labeling. The community structure of a social network is used to assist in constructing the conditional random field, and this makes our approach reasonable and accurate. In addition, the computational simplicity of pseudolikelihood effectively resolves the time complexity problem which RMNs are suffering. We apply our approach on two real-world social networks, one is a terrorist relation network and the other is a phone call network we collected from encrypted call detail records. In our experiments, for avoiding losing links while splitting a closely connected social network into separate training and test subsets, we split the datasets according to the links rather than the individuals.

Learning from constraints,Marco Gori (University of Siena);,2094020829,"In this talk, I propose a functional framework to understand the emergence of intelligence in agents exposed to examples and knowledge granules. The theory is based on the abstract notion of constraint, which provides a representation of knowledge granules gained from the interaction with the environment. I give a picture of the ""agent body"" in terms of representation theorems by extending the classic framework of kernel machines in such a way to incorporate logic formalisms, like first-order logic. This is made possible by the unification of continuous and discrete computational mechanisms in the same functional framework, so as any stimulus, like supervised examples and logic predicates, is translated into a constraint. The learning, which is based on constrained variational calculus, is either guided by a parsimonious match of the constraints or by unsupervised mechanisms expressed in terms of the minimization of the entropy. I show some experiments with different kinds of symbolic and subsymbolic constraints, and then I give insights on the adoption of the proposed framework in computer vision. It is shown that in most interesting tasks the learning from constraints naturally leads to ""deep architectures"", that emerge when following the developmental principle of focusing attention on ""easy constraints"", at each stage. Interestingly, this suggests that stage-based learning, as discussed in developmental psychology, might not be primarily the outcome of biology, but it could be instead the consequence of optimization principles and complexity issues that hold regardless of the ""body.""",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Highly dimensional problems in computational advertising,Andrei Z. Broder (Yahoo!);,2637163715,"The central problem of Computational Advertising is to find the ""best match"" between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement. The context could be a user entering a query in a search engine (""sponsored search""), a user reading a web page (""content match"" and ""display ads""), a user interacting with a portable device, and so on. The information about the user can vary from scarily detailed to practically nil. The number of potential advertisements might be in the billions. The number of contexts is unbound. Thus, depending on the definition of ""best match"" this problem leads to a variety of massive optimization and search problems, with complicated constraints. The solution to these problems provides the scientific and technical underpinnings of the online advertising industry, an industry estimated to surpass 28 billion dollars in US alone in 2011. An essential aspect of this problem is predicting the impact of an ad on users' behavior, whether immediate and easily quantifiable (e.g. clicking on ad or buying a product on line) or delayed and harder to measure (e.g. off-line buying or changes in brand perception). To this end, the three components of the problem - users, contexts, and ads - are represented as high dimensional objects and terabytes of data documenting the interactions among them are collected every day.

Some of these works exploit the use of nondominated policies, which are optimal policies for some instantiation of the imprecise reward function. An algorithm that calculates nondominated policies is π Witness, and nondominated policies are used to take decision under the minimax regret evaluation.

Inter-Event Dependencies support Event Extraction from Biomedical Literature,Roman Klinger (Fraunhofer Society);Sebastian Riedel (University College London);Andrew McCallum (University of Massachusetts Amherst);,"2149880524,1976791985,2131293038","The description of events in biomedical literature often follows discourse patterns. For example, authors may firstly mention the transcription of a gene, and then go on to describe how this transcription is regulated by another gene. Capturing such patterns can be beneficial when we want to extract event mentions from literature. For instance, detecting the mention of a transcription of gene A gives us a hint to actively look for mentions of regulations involving A. With this hint we could find such mentions even if they follow unseen lexical or syntactic patterns. To exploit such hints we need to perform event extraction in a cross sentence manner. It is shown that imperatively defined factor graphs (IDF) are an intuitive way to build Markov Networks that model inter-dependencies between mentions of events within sentences, and across sentence-boundaries. Small pieces of procedural code define the graph structure, feature functions and hooks for efficient inference. Empirically, this leads to an efficient cross-sentence event extractor with very competitive results on the BioNLP shared task. One of our inter-event features shows an impact of 1:94 points in F1 for the class of regulation events.",2011,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data science;world wide web;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

We compare two standard text classification approaches to identify `factual' and `non-factual' sentences in article titles; the first of which uses a statistical language-modelling approach, and the second a more sophisticated semantic and grammatical approach. We find that the simple approach provides more accurately classified titles; achiev- ing 92% overall accuracy compared to 90% for the complex approach.

Our method both outperforms several baseline methods and, in comparison to them, is faster and consumes less memory. We also demonstrate how our method learns an interpretable model, where annotations with alternate spellings or even languages are close in the embedding space. Hence, even when our model does not predict the exact annotation given by a human labeler, it often predicts similar annotations, a fact that we try to quantify by measuring the newly introduced ""sibling"" precision metric, where our method also obtains excellent results.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,embedding;metric;systems modeling;learning to rank;image processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

Cohen (Carnegie Mellon University);,"2145221253,2115385359","Scientific literature with rich metadata can be represented as a labeled directed graph. This graph representation enables a number of scientific tasks such as ad hoc retrieval or named entity recognition (NER) to be formulated as typed proximity queries in the graph. One popular proximity measure is called Random Walk with Restart (RWR), and much work has been done on the supervised learning of RWR measures by associating each edge label with a parameter. In this paper, we describe a novel learnable proximity measure which instead uses one weight per edge label sequence: proximity is defined by a weighted combination of simple ""path experts"", each corresponding to following a particular sequence of labeled edges. Experiments on eight tasks in two subdomains of biology show that the new learning method significantly outperforms the RWR model (both trained and untrained). We also extend the method to support two additional types of experts to model intrinsic properties of entities: query-independent experts, which generalize the PageRank measure, and popular entity experts which allow rankings to be adjusted for particular entities that are especially important.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,directed graph;learning to rank;supervised learning;graph theory;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

We solve for the Nash equilibrium which is a pair of strategies (classifier weights, data transformations) from which there is no incentive for either the data miner or the adversary to deviate.

However, the relaxation can only be applied to two-class cases.

An efficient gradient descend optimization approach is introduced to obtain the p-Laplacian embedding space, which is guaranteed to converge to feasible local solutions.

This geometric interpretation allows one to view the hyperparameters of conjugate priors as the effective sample points, thus providing additional intuition.

Deployed recommender systems, on the other hand, operate over time, and recommendations may be damaged while sybils are still injecting their profiles, rather than only after all malicious ratings have been input. Furthermore, system administrators do not know when their system is under attack, and thus when to run these classification techniques, thus risking to leave their recommender system vulnerable to attacks.

Compared with other descriptive techniques, like classical support/confidence association rules, subgroup discovery has the advantage that it comes up with only the top-k patterns, and that it makes use of a quality function that avoids patterns uncorrelated with the target. If these techniques are to be applied in privacy-sensitive scenarios involving distributed data, precise guarantees are needed regarding the amount of information leaked during the execution of the data mining. Unfortunately, the adaptation of secure multi-party protocols for classical support/confidence association rule mining to the task of subgroup discovery is impossible for fundamental reasons. The source is the different quality function and the restriction to a fixed number of patterns - i.e. exactly the desired features of subgroup discovery.

Here we argue that this leads to noisy patterns that hurt precision, in particular if the knowledge base is not directly related to the text we are working with. We present a novel approach to distant supervision that can alleviate this problem based on the following two ideas: First, we use a factor graph to explicitly model the decision whether two entities are related, and the decision whether this relation is mentioned in a given sentence; second, we apply constraint-driven semi-supervision to train this model without any knowledge about which sentences express the relations in our training KB.

Recently, it has been recognized that strongly-typed heterogeneous information networks are prevalent in the real world. Sometimes, label information is available for some objects. Learning from such labeled and unlabeled data via transductive classification can lead to good knowledge extraction of the hidden network structure. However, although classification on homogeneous networks has been studied for decades, classification on heterogeneous networks has not been explored until recently. In this paper, we consider the transductive classification problem on heterogeneous networked data which share a common topic. Only some objects in the given network are labeled, and we aim to predict labels for all types of the remaining objects. A novel graph-based regularization framework, GNetMine, is proposed to model the link structure in information networks with arbitrary network schema and arbitrary number of object/link types. Specifically, we explicitly respect the type differences by preserving consistency over each relation graph corresponding to each type of links separately.

We present DXMiner, which addresses four major challenges to data stream classification, namely, infinite length, concept-drift, concept-evolution, and feature-evolution. Data streams are assumed to be infinite in length, which necessitates single-pass incremental learning techniques. Concept-drift occurs in a data stream when the underlying concept changes over time. Most existing data stream classification techniques address only the infinite length and concept-drift problems. However, concept-evolution and feature- evolution are also major challenges, and these are ignored by most of the existing approaches. Concept-evolution occurs in the stream when novel classes arrive, and feature-evolution occurs when new features emerge in the stream. Our previous work addresses the concept-evolution problem in addition to addressing the infinite length and concept-drift problems. Most of the existing data stream classification techniques, including our previous work, assume that the feature space of the data points in the stream is static. This assumption may be impractical for some type of data, for example text data. DXMiner considers the dynamic nature of the feature space and provides an elegant solution for classification and novel class detection when the feature space is dynamic. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art stream classification techniques in classifying and detecting novel classes in real data streams.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data stream clustering;concept drift;feature vector;data stream mining;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;

Learning from two different kinds of supervision adds a challenging dimension to the problem of active learning.

For all these algorithms, it is possible to derive an optimization procedure which corresponds to an iterative projection algorithm. Second, we discuss the effect of a preconditioning of the optimization procedure achieved by adding a strictly convex functional to the objective function. Structured sparsity algorithms are usually based on minimizing a convex (not strictly convex) objective function and this might lead to undesired unstable behavior. We show that by perturbing the objective function by a small strictly convex term we often reduce substantially the number of required computations without affecting the prediction performance of the obtained solution.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,proximal gradient methods for learning;regularization perspectives on support vector machines;proper convex function;proximal gradient methods;support function;convex analysis;linear matrix inequality;convex function;conic optimization;convex optimization;combinatorics;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;
Learning to tag from open vocabulary labels,Burr Settles (Carnegie Mellon University);Tom M. Mitchell (Carnegie Mellon University);,"2004754343,2151014374","Most approaches to classifying media content assume a fixed, closed vocabulary of labels. In contrast, we advocate machine learning approaches which take advantage of the millions of free-form tags obtainable via online crowd-sourcing platforms and social tagging websites. The use of such open vocabularies presents learning challenges due to typographical errors, synonymy, and a potentially unbounded set of tag labels. In this work, we present a new approach that organizes these noisy tags into well-behaved semantic classes using topic modeling, and learn to predict tags accurately using a mixture of topic classes. This method can utilize an arbitrary open vocabulary of tags, reduces training time by 94% compared to learning from these tags directly, and achieves comparable performance for classification and superior performance for retrieval. We also demonstrate that on open vocabulary tasks, human evaluations are essential for measuring the true performance of tag classifiers, which traditional evaluation methods will consistently underestimate.

Fast and scalable algorithms for semi-supervised link prediction on static and dynamic graphs,Rudy Raymond (IBM);Hisashi Kashima (University of Tokyo);,"2223610691,2428201863","Recent years have witnessed a widespread interest on methods using both link structure and node information for link prediction on graphs. One of the state-of-the-art methods is Link Propagation which is a new semi-supervised learning algorithm for link prediction on graphs based on the popularly-studied label propagation by exploiting information on similarities of links and nodes. Despite its efficiency and effectiveness compared to other methods, its applications were still limited due to the computational time and space constraints. In this paper, we propose fast and scalable algorithms for the Link Propagation by introducing efficient procedures to solve large linear equations that appear in the method. In particular, we show how to obtain a compact representation of the solution to the linear equations by using a non-trivial combination of techniques in linear algebra to construct algorithms that are also effective for link prediction on dynamic graphs. These enable us to apply the Link Propagation to large networks with more than 400,000 nodes.

We show that SINCO is often comparable to, and, in various cases, outperforms commonly used approaches such as glasso [7] and COVSEL [1], in terms of both structure-reconstruction error (particularly, false positive error) and computational time. Moreover, our method has the advantage of being easily parallelizable. Finally, we show that SINCO's greedy nature allows reproduction of the regularization path behavior by applying the method to one (sufficiently small) instance of the regularization parameter λ only; thus, SINCO can obtain a desired number of network links directly, without having to tune the λ parameter.

The main challenge is that the source and target domains may have different distributions. An open problem is how to select the available models (including algorithms and parameters) and importantly, abundance of source-domain data, through statistically reliable methods, thus making transfer learning practical and easy-to-use for real-world applications. To address this challenge, one needs to take into account the difference in both marginal and conditional distributions in the same time, but not just one of them. In this paper, we formulate a new criterion to overcome ""double"" distribution shift and present a practical approach ""Transfer Cross Validation"" (TrCV) to select both models and data in a cross validation framework, optimized for transfer learning. The idea is to use density ratio weighting to overcome the difference in marginal distributions and propose a ""reverse validation"" procedure to quantify how well a model approximates the true conditional distribution of target-domain. The usefulness of TrCV is demonstrated on different cross-domain tasks, including wine quality evaluation, web-user ranking and text categorization.

Fast active exploration for link-based preference learning using Gaussian processes,Zhao Xu (Fraunhofer Society);Kristian Kersting (Fraunhofer Society);Thorsten Joachims (Cornell University);,"2279588302,2252032993,245171893","In preference learning, the algorithm observes pairwise relative judgments (preference) between items as training data for learning an ordering of all items. This is an important learning problem for applications where absolute feedback is difficult to elicit, but pairwise judgments are readily available (e.g., via implicit feedback [13]). While it was already shown that active learning can effectively reduce the number of training pairs needed, the most successful existing algorithms cannot generalize over items or queries. Considering web search as an example, they would need to learn a separate relevance score for each document-query pair from scratch. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose a link-based active preference learning method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) that incorporates dependency information from both feature-vector representations as well as relations. Specifically, to meet the requirement on computational efficiency of active exploration, we introduce a novel incremental update method that scales as well as the nongeneralizing models. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on datasets for information retrieval, showing that it learns substantially faster than algorithms that cannot model dependencies.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,stability;preference learning;active learning;generalization error;gaussian process;

Expectation propagation for Bayesian multi-task feature selection,Daniel Hernández-Lobato (Université catholique de Louvain);José Miguel Hernández-Lobato (Autonomous University of Madrid);Thibault Helleputte (Université catholique de Louvain);Pierre Dupont (Université catholique de Louvain);,"1517651870,2395024022,2060724671,2238207816","In this paper we propose a Bayesian model for multitask feature selection. This model is based on a generalized spike and slab sparse prior distribution that enforces the selection of a common subset of features across several tasks. Since exact Bayesian inference in this model is intractable, approximate inference is performed through expectation propagation (EP). EP approximates the posterior distribution of the model using a parametric probability distribution. This posterior approximation is particularly useful to identify relevant features for prediction. We focus on problems for which the number of features d is significantly larger than the number of instances for each task. We propose an efficient parametrization of the EP algorithm that offers a computational complexity linear in d. Experiments on several multitask datasets show that the proposed model outperforms baseline approaches for single-task learning or data pooling across all tasks, as well as two state-of-the-art multi-task learning approaches.

This vector representation is then relaxed by a merging algorithm, which identifies the maximal representative portions of each trajectory, at the same time preserving the space-time mobility pattern of the trajectory. Finally, a novel sampling algorithm operating on the previous representation is proposed, allowing us to select a subset of a TD in an unsupervised way encapsulating the behavior (in terms of mobility patterns) of the original TD.

In large-scale tag-based systems, tag recommendation services can assist a user in the assignment of tags to objects and help consolidate the vocabulary of tags across users. A promising approach for tag recommendation is to exploit the co-occurrence of tags. However, these methods are challenged by the huge size of the tag vocabulary, either because (1) the computational complexity may increase exponentially with the number of tags or (2) the score associated with each tag may become distorted since different tags may operate in different scales and the scores are not directly comparable. In this paper we propose a novel method that recommends tags on a demand-driven basis according to an initial set of tags applied to an object. It reduces the space of possible solutions, so that its complexity increases polynomially with the size of the tag vocabulary. Further, the score of each tag is calibrated using an entropy minimization approach which corrects possible distortions and provides more precise recommendations. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using three types of media: audio, bookmarks and video. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast and boosts recommendation quality on different experimental scenarios. For instance, in the case of a popular audio site it provides improvements in precision (p@5) ranging from 6.4% to 46.7% (depending on the number of tags given as input), outperforming a recently proposed co-occurrence based tag recommendation method.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,computational complexity theory;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;

Clustered anomalies are able to avoid detection since they defy these assumptions by being dense and, in many cases, in close proximity to normal instances. In this paper, without using any density or distance measure, we propose a new method called SCiForest to detect clustered anomalies.

We investigate the performance of these alignment kernels in combination with a trajectory compression method.

Constrained parameter estimation for semi-supervised learning: the case of the nearest mean classifier,Marco Loog (Delft University of Technology);,1996663063,"A rather simple semi-supervised version of the equally simple nearest mean classifier is presented. However simple, the proposed approach is of practical interest as the nearest mean classifier remains a relevant tool in biomedical applications or other areas dealing with relatively high-dimensional feature spaces or small sample sizes. More importantly, the performance of our semi-supervised nearest mean classifier is typically expected to improve over that of its standard supervised counterpart and typically does not deteriorate with increasing numbers of unlabeled data. This behavior is achieved by constraining the parameters that are estimated to comply with relevant information in the unlabeled data, which leads, in expectation, to a more rapid convergence to the large-sample solution because the variance of the estimate is reduced. In a sense, our proposal demonstrates that it may be possible to properly train a known classification scheme such that it can benefit from unlabeled data, while avoiding the additional assumptions typically made in semi-supervised learning.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,feature vector;estimation theory;semi supervised learning;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

This can serve to structure the graph space and to improve the understanding of the data. In this paper, we present a novel method for structural graph clustering, i.e. graph clustering without generating features or decomposing graphs into parts. In contrast to many related approaches, the method does not rely on computationally expensive maximum common subgraph (MCS) operations or variants thereof, but on frequent subgraph mining. More specifically, our problem formulation takes advantage of the frequent subgraph miner gSpan (that performs well on many practical problems) without effectively generating thousands of subgraphs in the process. In the proposed clustering approach, clusters encompass all graphs that share a sufficiently large common subgraph. The size of the common subgraph of a graph in a cluster has to take at least a user-specified fraction of its overall size.

Topic modeling for personalized recommendation of volatile items,Maks Ovsjanikov (Stanford University);Ye Chen (Microsoft);,"168721329,2638972202","One of the major strengths of probabilistic topic modeling is the ability to reveal hidden relations via the analysis of co-occurrence patterns on dyadic observations, such as document-term pairs. However, in many practical settings, the extreme sparsity and volatility of co-occurrence patterns within the data, when the majority of terms appear in a single document, limits the applicability of topic models. In this paper, we propose an efficient topic modeling framework in the presence of volatile dyadic observations when direct topic modeling is infeasible. We show both theoretically and empirically that often-available unstructured and semantically-rich meta-data can serve as a link between dyadic sets, and can allow accurate and efficient inference. Our approach is general and can work with most latent variable models, which rely on stable dyadic data, such as pLSI, LDA, and GaP. Using transactional data from a major e-commerce site, we demonstrate the effectiveness as well as the applicability of our method in a personalized recommendation system for volatile items. Our experiments show that the proposed learning method outperforms the traditional LDA by capturing more persistent relations between dyadic sets of wide and practical significance.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,transaction data;latent variable model;recommender system;data science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

Traditionally, the focus of these studies was on the efficiency of the computation and the scalability towards very large databases. Little research has however been done on a general framework that encompasses several of these problems. In earlier work we showed how constraint programming (CP) can offer such a general framework; unfortunately, however, we also found that out-of-the-box CP solvers lack the efficiency and scalability achieved by specialized itemset mining systems, which could discourage their use. Here we study the question whether a framework can be built that inherits the generality of CP systems and the efficiency of specialized algorithms. We propose a CP-based framework for pattern mining that avoids the redundant representations and propagations found in existing CP systems. We show experimentally that an implementation of this framework performs comparable to specialized itemset mining systems; furthermore, under certain conditions it lists itemsets with polynomial delay, which demonstrates that it also is a promising approach for analyzing pattern mining tasks from more theoretical perspectives.

Permutation testing improves Bayesian network learning,Ioannis Tsamardinos (University of Crete);Giorgos Borboudakis (University of Crete);,"2619192764,2028001986","We are taking a peek ""under the hood"" of constraint-based learning of graphical models such as Bayesian Networks. This mainstream approach to learning is founded on performing statistical tests of conditional independence. In all prior work however, the tests employed for categorical data are only asymptotically-correct, i.e., they converge to the exact p-value in the sample limit. In this paper we present, evaluate, and compare exact tests, based on standard, adjustable, and semi-parametric Monte-Carlo permutation testing procedures appropriate for small sample sizes. It is demonstrated that (a) permutation testing is calibrated, i.e, the actual Type I error matches the significance level α set by the user; this is not the case with asymptotic tests, (b) permutation testing leads to more robust structural learning, and (c) permutation testing allows learning networks from multiple datasets sharing a common underlying structure but different distribution functions (e.g. continuous vs. discrete); we name this problem the Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis problem. In contrast, asymptotic tests may lead to erratic learning behavior in this task (error increasing with total sample-size). The semi-parametric permutation procedure we propose is a reasonable approximation of the basic procedure using 5000 permutations, while being only 10-20 times slower than the asymptotic tests for small sample sizes. Thus, this test should be practical in most graphical learning problems and could substitute asymptotic tests.

A cluster-level semi-supervision model for interactive clustering,Avinava Dubey (IBM);Indrajit Bhattacharya (Indian Institute of Science);Shantanu Godbole (IBM);,"2311803151,2117917354,2166939104","Semi-supervised clustering models, that incorporate user provided constraints to yield meaningful clusters, have recently become a popular area of research. In this paper, we propose a cluster-level semi-supervision model for inter-active clustering. Prototype based clustering algorithms typically alternate between updating cluster descriptions and assignment of data items to clusters. In our model, the user provides semi-supervision directly for these two steps. Assignment feedback re-assigns data items among existing clusters, while cluster description feedback helps to position existing cluster centers more meaningfully. We argue that providing such supervision is more natural for exploratory data mining, where the user discovers and interprets clusters as the algorithm progresses, in comparison to the pair-wise instance level supervision model, particularly for high dimensional data such as document collection. We show how such feedback can be interpreted as constraints and incorporated within the kmeans clustering framework. Using experimental results on multiple real-world datasets, we show that this framework improves clustering performance significantly beyond traditional k-means.

To achieve low sample complexity, since the environment is unknown, an agent must intelligently balance exploration and exploitation, and must be able to rapidly generalize from observations. While in the past a number of related sample efficient RL algorithms have been proposed, to allow theoretical analysis, mainly model-learners with weak generalization capabilities were considered. Here, we separate function approximation in the model learner (which does require samples) from the interpolation in the planner (which does not require samples). For model-learning we apply Gaussian processes regression (GP) which is able to automatically adjust itself to the complexity of the problem (via Bayesian hyperparameter selection) and, in practice, often able to learn a highly accurate model from very little data. In addition, a GP provides a natural way to determine the uncertainty of its predictions, which allows us to implement the ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"" principle used to efficiently control exploration.

Indeed, a large number of losses has already been proposed and is commonly applied as performance metrics in experimental studies. However, even though these loss functions are of a quite different nature, a concrete connection between the type of multi-label classifier used and the loss to be minimized is rarely established, implicitly giving the misleading impression that the same method can be optimal for different loss functions. In this paper, we elaborate on risk minimization and the connection between loss functions in MLC, both theoretically and empirically. In particular, we compare two important loss functions, namely the Hamming loss and the subset 0/1 loss. We perform a regret analysis, showing how poor a classifier intended to minimize the subset 0/1 loss can become in terms of Hamming loss and vice versa.

Smarter sampling in model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning,Pablo Samuel Castro (McGill University);Doina Precup (McGill University);,"2120794264,2049838","Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) is aimed at making more efficient use of data samples, but typically uses significantly more computation. For discrete Markov Decision Processes, a typical approach to Bayesian RL is to sample a set of models from an underlying distribution, and compute value functions for each, e.g. using dynamic programming. This makes the computation cost per sampled model very high. Furthermore, the number of model samples to take at each step has mainly been chosen in an ad-hoc fashion. We propose a principled method for determining the number of models to sample, based on the parameters of the posterior distribution over models. Our sampling method is local, in that we may choose a different number of samples for each state-action pair.

Here, we describe learning algorithms based on chance constrained programs and show that they exhibit all the properties needed for a good link predictor, namely, they allow preferential bias to positive or negative class; handle skewness in the data; and scale to large networks.

Nevertheless, it is worth noting that when the predictive distribution P(y|x) of the domains differs, which establishes Negative Transfer [19], DA approaches generally fail to perform well. Taking this cue, the Predictive Distribution Matching SVM (PDM-SVM) is proposed to learn a robust classifier in the target domain (referred to as the target classifier) by leveraging the labeled data from only the relevant regions of multiple sources. In particular, a k-nearest neighbor graph is iteratively constructed to identify the regions of relevant source labeled data where the predictive distribution maximally aligns with that of the target data. Predictive distribution matching regularization is then introduced to leverage these relevant source labeled data for training the target classifier. In addition, progressive transduction is adopted to infer the label of target unlabeled data for estimating the predictive distribution of the target domain. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate the impact of Negative Transfer on several existing state-of-the-art DA methods, and demonstrate the improved performance efficacy of our proposed PDM-SVM on the commonly used multi-domain Sentiment and Reuters datasets.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,posterior predictive distribution;k nearest neighbors algorithm;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

Once graph-based representations are constructed, an important question is how to compare graphs. This problem is often formulated as a graph matching problem where one seeks a mapping between vertices of two graphs which optimally aligns their structure. In the classical formulation of graph matching, only one-to-one correspondences between vertices are considered. However, in many applications, graphs cannot be matched perfectly and it is more interesting to consider many-to-many correspondences where clusters of vertices in one graph are matched to clusters of vertices in the other graph.

Current learning theory for single-agent systems does not extend to multi-agent problems. In a MAS the reinforcement an agent receives may depend on the actions taken by the other agents present in the system. Hence, the Markov property no longer holds and convergence guarantees are lost. Currently there does not exist a general formal theory describing and elucidating the conditions under which algorithms for multi-agent learning (MAL) are successful. Therefore it is important to fully understand the dynamics of multi-agent reinforcement learning, and to be able to analyze learning behavior in terms of stability and resilience of equilibria. Recent work has considered the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory for this purpose. In this paper we contribute to this framework. More precisely, we formally derive the evolutionary dynamics of the Regret Minimization polynomial weights learning algorithm, which will be described by a system of differential equations. Using these equations we can easily investigate parameter settings and analyze the dynamics of multiple concurrently learning agents using regret minimization. In this way it is clear why certain attractors are stable and potentially preferred over others, and what the basins of attraction look like. Furthermore, we experimentally show that the dynamics predict the real learning behavior and we test the dynamics also in nonself play, comparing the polynomial weights algorithm against the previously derived dynamics of Q-learning and various Linear Reward algorithms in a set of benchmark normal form games.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,stability;empirical risk minimization;minimal polynomial;markov property;evolutionary game theory;evolutionary dynamics;learning theory;differential equation;algorithmic learning theory;computational learning theory;multi agent system;reinforcement learning;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical optimization;statistics;mathematics;

In this work we introduce a semisupervised approach that can tackle multi-level bRE via string comparisons with mismatches in the string kernel framework.

Specifically, two unsupervised models are proposed to capture contextual (local or global) semantic similarities between words from a large unannotated corpus. This Abstraction-augmented String Kernel (ASK) allows for better generalization of patterns learned from annotated data and provides a unified framework for solving bRE with multiple degrees of detail.

Many approaches to SAR use sets of binary substructure features, which test for the occurrence of certain substructures in the molecular graph. As an alternative to enumerating very large sets of frequent patterns, numerous pattern set mining and pattern set selection techniques have been proposed. Existing approaches can be broadly classified into those that focus on minimizing correspondences, that is, the number of pairs of training instances from different classes with identical encodings and those that focus on maximizing the number of equivalence classes, that is, unique encodings in the training data. In this paper we evaluate a number of techniques to investigate which criterion is a better indicator of predictive accuracy. We find that minimizing correspondences is a necessary but not sufficient condition for good predictive accuracy, that equivalence classes are a better indicator of success and that it is important to have a good match between training set and pattern set size.

An appealing approach to reducing the number of expensive evaluations is Bayesian Optimization (BO), which is a framework for global optimization of noisy and costly to evaluate functions. Prior work in a number of RL domains has demonstrated the effectiveness of BO for optimizing parametric policies. However, those approaches completely ignore the state-transition sequence of policy executions and only consider the total reward achieved. In this paper, we study how to more effectively incorporate all of the information observed during policy executions into the BO framework. In particular, our approach uses the observed data to learn approximate transitions models that allow for Monte-Carlo predictions of policy returns. The models are then incorporated into the BO framework as a type of prior on policy returns, which can better inform the BO process. The resulting algorithm provides a new approach for leveraging learned models in RL even when there is no planner available for exploiting those models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in four benchmark domains, which have dynamics of variable complexity. Results indicate that our algorithm effectively combines model based predictions to improve the data efficiency of model free BO methods, and is robust to modeling errors when parts of the domain cannot be modeled successfully.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,evaluation function;errors in variables models;domain model;monte carlo method;reinforcement learning;global optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;mathematical optimization;statistics;computer science;

Hidden conditional ordinal random fields for sequence classification,Minyoung Kim (Rutgers University);Vladimir Pavlovic (Rutgers University);,"2306773130,1969768610","Conditional Random Fields and Hidden Conditional Random Fields are a staple of many sequence tagging and classification frameworks. An underlying assumption in those models is that the state sequences (tags), observed or latent, take their values from a set of nominal categories. These nominal categories typically indicate tag classes (e.g., part-of-speech tags) or clusters of similar measurements. However, in some sequence modeling settings it is more reasonable to assume that the tags indicate ordinal categories or ranks. Dynamic envelopes of sequences such as emotions or movements often exhibit intensities growing from neutral, through raising, to peak values. In this work we propose a new model family, Hidden Conditional Ordinal Random Fields (HCORFs), that explicitly models sequence dynamics as the dynamics of ordinal categories. We formulate those models as generalizations of ordinal regressions to structured (here sequence) settings. We show how classification of entire sequences can be formulated as an instance of learning and inference in H-CORFs. In modeling the ordinal-scale latent variables, we incorporate recent binning-based strategy used for static ranking approaches, which leads to a log-nonlinear model that can be optimized by efficient quasi-Newton or stochastic gradient type searches.

Second, to represent each cluster in the hierarchy by an intuitive description with e.g. a probability density function. Third, to consistently handle outliers. And finally, to avoid difficult parameter settings.With ITCH, we propose a novel clustering method that is built on a hierarchical variant of the information-theoretic principle of Minimum Description Length (MDL), referred to as hMDL. Interpreting the hierarchical cluster structure as a statistical model of the data set, it can be used for effective data compression by Huffman coding.

For a database, getting a first impression is not so straightforward. While low-order statistics only provide limited insight, mining the data quickly provides too much detail. In this paper we propose a middle ground, and introduce a parameter-free method for constructing high-quality summaries for binary data. Our method builds a summary by grouping items that strongly correlate, and uses the Minimum Description Length principle to identify the best grouping --without requiring a distance measure between items. Besides offering a practical overview of which attributes interact most strongly, these summaries are also easily-queried surrogates for the data.

Particle Filters (PF) perform that task, yielding probability distribution over the unobserved variables. However, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality problem: the necessary number of particles grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the hidden state space. The problem is aggravated when the initial distribution of the variables is not well known, as happens in global localization problems. In this paper we present two new adaptive sampling mechanisms for PFs for systems whose variable dependencies can be factored into a Dynamic Bayesian Network. The novel PFs, developed over the proposed sampling mechanisms, exploit the strengths of other existing PFs. Their adaptive mechanisms 1) modify or establish probabilistic links among the subspaces of hidden variables that are independently explored to build particles consistent with the current measurements and past history, and 2) tune the performance of the new PFs toward the behaviors of several existing PFs. We demonstrate their performance on some complex dynamical system estimation problems, showing that our methods successfully localize and track hidden states, and outperform some of the existing PFs.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,dynamic bayesian network;hidden variable theory;particle filter;curse of dimensionality;state space;dynamical system;probability distribution;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

A natural approach to learning involves transforming the spectrum of a graph Laplacian to obtain a kernel. While manual exploration of the spectrum is conceivable, non-parametric learning methods that adjust the Laplacian's spectrum promise better performance. For instance, adjusting the graph Laplacian using kernel target alignment (KTA) yields better performance when an SVM is trained on the resulting kernel. KTA relies on a simple surrogate criterion to choose the kernel; the obtained kernel is then fed to a large margin classification algorithm. In this paper, we propose novel formulations that jointly optimize relative margin and the spectrum of a kernel defined via Laplacian eigenmaps.

The connection also suggests to post-process ensembles with sophisticated linear separators such as Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Nikolaev (Goldsmiths, University of London);","2122405168,2298277179,2119324543","k-Version spaces were introduced in [6] to handle noisy data. They were defined as sets of k-consistent hypotheses; i.e., hypotheses consistent with all but k instances. Although k-version spaces were applied, their implementation was intractable due to the boundary-set representation. This paper argues that to classify with k-version spaces we do not need an explicit representation. Instead we need to solve a general k-consistency problem and a general k0-consistency problem. The general k-consistency problem is to test the hypothesis space for classifier that is k-consistent with the data. The general k0-consistency problem is to test the hypothesis space for classifier that is k-consistent with the data and 0-consistent with a labeled test instance. Hence, our main result is that the k-version-space classification can be (tractably) implemented if we have (tractable) k-consistency-test algorithms and (tractable) k0-consistency-test algorithms.

Hub gene selection methods for the reconstruction of transcription networks,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato (Autonomous University of Madrid);Tjeerd M. H. Dijkstra (Radboud University Nijmegen);,"2395024022,2304787293","Transcription control networks have a scale-free topological structure: While most genes are involved in a reduced number of links, a few hubs or key regulators are connected to a significantly large number of nodes. Several methods have been developed for the reconstruction of these networks from gene expression data, e.g. ARACNE. However, few of them take into account the scale-free structure of transcription networks. In this paper, we focus on the hubs that commonly appear in scale-free networks. First, three feature selection methods are proposed for the identification of those genes that are likely to be hubs and second, we introduce an improvement in ARACNE so that this technique can take into account the list of hub genes generated by the feature selection methods. Experiments with synthetic gene expression data validate the accuracy of the feature selection methods in the task of identifying hub genes. When ARACNE is combined with the output of these methods, we achieve up to a 62% improvement in performance over the original reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the best method for identifying hub genes is validated on a set of expression profiles from yeast.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,scale free network;feature selection;bioinformatics;data mining;machine learning;computer science;

Traditional semi-supervised projection clustering methods hold the assumption that the data and pairwise constraints are all drawn from the same domain. However, many related data sets with different distributions are available in real applications. The traditional methods thus can not be directly extended to such a scenario. One major challenging issue is how to exploit constraint knowledge from multiple source domains and transfer it to the target domain where all the data are unlabeled. To handle this difficulty, we are motivated to construct a common subspace where the difference in distributions among domains can be reduced. We also invent a transferred centroid regularization, which acts as a bridge to transfer the constraint knowledge to the target domain, to formulate this geometric structure formed by the centroids from different domains.

Rather than being represented in a p-dimensional space, images can typically be encoded in the form of strings, trees or graphs and are usually compared either by computing suited metrics such as the (string or tree)-edit distance, or by testing subgraph isomorphism. In this paper, we propose a new way for representing images in the form of strings whose symbols are weighted according to a TF-IDF-based weighting scheme, inspired from information retrieval. To be able to handle such real-valued weights, we first introduce a new weighted string edit distance that keeps the properties of a distance. In particular, we prove that the triangle inequality is preserved which allows the computation of the edit distance in quadratic time by dynamic programming. We show on an image classification task that our new weighted edit distance not only significantly outperforms the standard edit distance but also seems very competitive in comparison with standard histogram distances-based approaches.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,string to string correction problem;wagner fischer algorithm;jaro winkler distance;damerau levenshtein distance;edit distance;triangle inequality;distance;contextual image classification;discrete mathematics;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

Our numerical results indicate that learners producing a weighted majority vote based on the empirical risk of the randomized majority vote at some finite margin have no significant advantage over learners that achieve this same task based on the empirical risk at zero margin.

Asking generalized queries to ambiguous oracle,Jun Du (University of Western Ontario);Charles X. Ling (University of Western Ontario);,"2619459523,1980182462","Asking generalized queries (by regarding some features as don't-care) in active learning has been proposed and studied recently. As each generalized query is equivalent to a set of specific ones, the answers from the oracle can usually provide more information thus speeding up the learning effectively. However, as the answers to the generalized queries might be uncertain, previous studies often assume that the oracle is capable of providing (accurate) probabilistic answers. This assumption, however, is often too stringent in real-world situations. In this paper, we make a more realistic assumption that the oracle can only provide (non-probabilistic) ambiguous answers, similar to the setting in multiple-instance learning. That is, the generalized query is labeled positive if at least one of the corresponding specific queries is positive, and is labeled negative otherwise. We therefore propose an algorithm to construct the generalized queries and improve the learning model with such ambiguous answers in active learning. Empirical study shows that, the proposed algorithm can significantly speed up the learning process, and outperform active learning with either specific queries or inaccurately answered generalized queries.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,sample exclusion dimension;active learning;generalization error;empirical research;active learning;proactive learning;semi supervised learning;instance based learning;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;

Complexity bounds for batch active learning in classification,Philippe Rolet (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation);Olivier Teytaud (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation);,"267895411,154712921","Active learning [1] is a branch of Machine Learning in which the learning algorithm, instead of being directly provided with pairs of problem instances and their solutions (their labels), is allowed to choose, from a set of unlabeled data, which instances to query. It is suited to settings where labeling instances is costly. This paper analyzes the speed-up of batch (parallel) active learning compared to sequential active learning (where instances are chosen 1 by 1): how faster can an algorithm become if it can query λ instances at once?. There are two main contributions: proving lower and upper bounds on the possible gain, and illustrating them by experimenting on usual active learning algorithms. Roughly speaking, the speed-up is asymptotically logarithmic in the batch size λ (i.e. when λ → ∞). However, for some classes of functions with finite VC-dimension V, a linear speed-up can be achieved until a batch size of V. Practically speaking, this means that parallelizing computations on an expensive-to-label problem which is suited to active learning is very beneficial until V simultaneous queries, and less interesting (yet still bringing improvement) afterwards.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,online machine learning;stability;wake sleep algorithm;active learning;generalization error;vc dimension;active learning;semi supervised learning;computational learning theory;instance based learning;theoretical computer science;data mining;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

The key observation is that when the dimensionality of the data exceeds its quantity, it is always possible to find a linear transformation that preserves a given subset of distances, while changing the distances of another subset. Our method first maps the points into a high-dimensional feature space, and then explicitly searches for an affine transformation that preserves local distances while pulling non-neighbor points as far apart as possible. This search is formulated as an instance of semidefinite programming, and the resulting transformation can be used to map out-of-sample points into the embedded space.",2010,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,diffusion map;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;curse of dimensionality;dimensionality reduction;feature vector;affine transformation;linear map;discrete mathematics;machine learning;mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;

Here, we propose a more flexible alternative: instead of using the same basis vectors over the whole feature space, our solution uses different basis vectors in different parts of the feature space. At the core of our solution lies an optimization procedure that, given a set of basis vectors, finds a good partition of the feature space and good subsets of the existing basis vectors. Using this procedure repeatedly, we build trees whose internal nodes specify feature space partitions and whose leaves implement simple kernel classifiers. Experiments suggest that our method reduces classification time significantly while maintaining performance.

This article then introduces the concept of variation consistency to characterize pattern functions and uses this notion to propose GALLOP, an algorithm that outperforms existing algorithms to extract locally optimal itemsets.

Tag recommendation using probabilistic topic models,Ralf Krestel (Leibniz University of Hanover);Peter Fankhauser (Leibniz University of Hanover);,"2094185560,149446523","Tagging systems have become major infrastructures on the Web. They allow users to create tags that annotate and categorize content and share them with other users, very helpful in particular for searching multimedia content. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and annotation guidelines, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. Especially new resources annotated by only a few users have often rather idiosyncratic tags that do not reect a common perspective useful for search. In this paper we introduce an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for recommending tags of resources. Resources annotated by many users and thus equipped with a fairly stable and complete tag set are used to elicit latent topics represented as a mixture of description tokens and tags. Based on this, new resources are mapped to latent topics based on their content in order to recommend the most likely tags from the latent topics.

In this context, collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging: in these platforms users can annotate resources they like with freely chosen keyword (called tags) in order to make retrieval of information and serendipitous browsing more and more easier. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems (called tag recommenders) is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated by exploiting different approaches. In this paper we present a tag recommender developed for the ECML-PKDD 2009 Discovery Challenge. Our approach is based on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,web 2 0;recommender system;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;

In our approach, we either generate tags (from the content of the given resource data or after crawling additional resources) or we request tags from tagging services. We call each of this tag sources a tag recommender. We then combine the results of the tag recommenders based on weighting factors. The weighting factors are determined experimentally by comparing generated and expected tags based on the available training data. This general idea is also used for the graph-based approach required to solve task 2.

Thus it is not an easy job to extract the most appropriate two to three tags to recommend for a target user. In addition, the recommendations should be unique for every user, since everyone's perspective for the page is different. In this paper, we treat the task of recommending tags as to find the most likely tags that would be chosen by the user. We first applied the TF-IDF algorithm on the limited description of the page content, in order to extract the keywords for the page.

Then, similar to the classical association rules framework, we derive graph-evolution rules from frequent patterns that satisfy a given minimum confidence constraint. We discuss merits and limits of alternative definitions of support and confidence, justifying the chosen framework.

Second, the improved sparsity can also make training of Kernel SVMs more efficient, especially for high-dimensional and sparse data (e.g. text classification).

This problem is made more difficult when disagreement exists between views. We introduce a new unsupervised algorithm for combining information from related views, using a late integration strategy. Combination is performed by applying an approach based on matrix factorization to group related clusters produced on individual views. This yields a projection of the original clusters in the form of a new set of ""meta-clusters"" covering the entire domain.

We also show why other more naive methods of modifying uncertainty sampling to minimize total misclassification costs will not always work well.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,active learning;posterior probability;loss function;sampling;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;
Harnessing the Strengths of Anytime Algorithms for Constant Data Streams,Philipp Kranen (RWTH Aachen University);Thomas Seidl (RWTH Aachen University);,"2008431275,2140301036","Anytime algorithms have been proposed for many different applications e.g. in data mining. Their strengths are the ability to first provide a result after a very short initialization and second to improve their result with additional time. Therefore, anytime algorithms have so far been used when the available processing time varies, e.g. on varying data streams. In this paper we propose to employ anytime algorithms on constant data streams, i.e. for tasks with constant time allowance. We introduce two approaches that harness the strengths of anytime algorithms on constant data streams and thereby improve the over all quality of the result with respect to the corresponding budget algorithm. We derive formulas for the expected performance gain and demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel approaches using existing anytime algorithms on benchmark data sets. The goal that was set and reached in this paper is to improve the quality of the result over that of traditional budget approaches, which are used in an abundance of stream mining applications. Using anytime classification as an example application we show for SVM, Bayes and nearest neighbor classifiers that both our novel approaches improve the classification accuracy for slow and fast data streams. The results confirm our general theoretic models and show the effectiveness of our approaches. The simple yet effective idea can be employed for any anytime algorithm along with a quality measure and motivates further research in e.g. classification confidence measures or anytime algorithms.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data science;data mining;machine learning;computer science;
Adaptive XML Tree Classification on Evolving Data Streams,Albert Bifet (Polytechnic University of Catalonia);Ricard Gavaldà (Polytechnic University of Catalonia);,"307521372,2253347400","We propose a new method to classify patterns, using closed and maximal frequent patterns as features. Generally, classification requires a previous mapping from the patterns to classify to vectors of features, and frequent patterns have been used as features in the past. Closed patterns maintain the same information as frequent patterns using less space and maximal patterns maintain approximate information. We use them to reduce the number of classification features. We present a new framework for XML tree stream classification. For the first component of our classification framework, we use closed tree mining algorithms for evolving data streams. For the second component, we use state of the art classification methods for data streams. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work on tree classification in streaming data varying with time.

On Structured Output Training: Hard Cases and an Efficient Alternative,Thomas Gärtner (Fraunhofer Society);Shankar Vembu (Fraunhofer Society);,"1891115510,2046581165","State-of-the-art structured prediction algorithms can be applied using off-the-shelf tools by implementing a joint kernel for inputs and outputs, and an algorithm for inference. The kernel is used for mapping the data to an appropriate feature space, while the inference algorithm is used for successively adding violated constraints to the optimisation problem. While this approach leads to efficient learning algorithms for many important real world problems, there are also many cases in which successively adding violated constraints is infeasible. As a simple yet relevant problem, we consider the prediction of routes (cyclic permutations) over a given set of points of interest. Solving this problem has many potential applications. For car drivers, prediction of individual routes can be used for intelligent car sharing applications or help optimise a hybrid vehicle's charge/discharge schedule.

We use a second set of parameters, μ , that control the radius introducing like that an explicit feature weighting mechanism in the SVM algorithm.

Non-redundant Subgroup Discovery Using a Closure System,Mario Boley (Fraunhofer Society);Henrik Grosskreutz (Fraunhofer Society);,"2074964178,290692522","Subgroup discovery is a local pattern discovery task, in which descriptions of subpopulations of a database are evaluated against some quality function. As standard quality functions are functions of the described subpopulation, we propose to search for equivalence classes of descriptions with respect to their extension in the database rather than individual descriptions. These equivalence classes have unique maximal representatives forming a closure system. We show that minimum cardinality representatives of each equivalence class can be found during the enumeration process of that closure system without additional cost, while finding a minimum representative of a single equivalence class is NP-hard. With several real-world datasets we demonstrate that search space and output are significantly reduced by considering equivalence classes instead of individual descriptions and that the minimum representatives constitute a family of subgroup descriptions that is of same or better expressive power than those generated by traditional methods.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,expressive power;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;computer science;mathematics;
Hybrid least-squares algorithms for approximate policy evaluation,Jeffrey Johns (University of Massachusetts Amherst);Marek Petrik (University of Massachusetts Amherst);Sridhar Mahadevan (University of Massachusetts Amherst);,"2132006382,1979722320,2133778237","The goal of approximate policy evaluation is to ""best"" represent a target value function according to a specific criterion.

Two popular least-squares algorithms for performing this task are the Bellman residual method, which minimizes the Bellman residual, and the fixed point method, which minimizes the projection of the Bellman residual. When used within policy iteration, the fixed point algorithm tends to ultimately find better performing policies whereas the Bellman residual algorithm exhibits more stable behavior between rounds of policy iteration. We propose two hybrid least-squares algorithms to try to combine the advantages of these algorithms.

Such non-Gaussian features are extremely important in a variety of application areas. As one application, we consider temperature series from weather stations across the US.

Unfortunately, these approaches identify only a predefined number of flat co-clusters. Instead, it is useful if the clusters are arranged in a hierarchical fashion because the hierarchy provides insides on the clusters. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical co-clustering, which builds two coupled hierarchies, one on the objects and one on features thus providing insights on both them.

The dimensions to be favored are previously selected from similar datasets in large microarray databases, hence performing inductive transfer learning at the feature level. This technique relies on a feature selection method embedded within a regularized linear model estimation. A practical approximation of this technique reduces to linear SVM learning with iterative input rescaling. The scaling factors depend on the selected dimensions from the related datasets.

Relevance Grounding for Planning in Relational Domains,Tobias Lang (Technical University of Berlin);Marc Toussaint (Technical University of Berlin);,"2148328070,2121676736","Probabilistic relational models are an efficient way to learn and represent the dynamics in realistic environments consisting of many objects. Autonomous intelligent agents that ground this representation for all objects need to plan in exponentially large state spaces and large sets of stochastic actions. A key insight for computational efficiency is that successful planning typically involves only a small subset of relevant objects. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model to represent planning with subsets of objects and provide a definition of object relevance. Our definition is sufficient to prove consistency between repeated planning in partially grounded models restricted to relevant objects and planning in the fully grounded model.

Transductive Classification via Dual Regularization,Quanquan Gu (Tsinghua University);Jie Zhou (Tsinghua University);,"2167348148,2304890293","Semi-supervised learning has witnessed increasing interest in the past decade. One common assumption behind semi-supervised learning is that the data labels should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic data manifold. Recent research has shown that the features also lie on a manifold. Moreover, there is a duality between data points and features, that is, data points can be classified based on their distribution on features, while features can be classified based on their distribution on the data points. However, existing semi-supervised learning methods neglect these points. Based on the above observations, in this paper, we present a dual regularization, which consists of two graph regularizers and a co-clustering type regularizer. In detail, the two graph regularizers consider the geometric structure of the data points and the features respectively, while the co-clustering type regularizer takes into account the duality between data points and features. Furthermore, we propose a novel transductive classification framework based on dual regularization, which can be solved by alternating minimization algorithm and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed.

When doing feature selection with multiple tasks, usually one can ""borrow strength"" across these tasks to get a more sensitive criterion for deciding which features to select. We propose a novel method, the Multiple Inclusion Criterion (MIC), which modifies stepwise feature selection to more easily select features that are helpful across multiple tasks. Our approach allows each feature to be added to none, some, or all of the tasks. MIC is most beneficial for selecting a small set of predictive features from a large pool of potential features, as is common in genomic and biological datasets. Experimental results on such datasets show that MIC usually outperforms other competing multi-task learning methods not only in terms of accuracy but also by building simpler and more interpretable models.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,multi task learning;feature;feature selection;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;

A clustering algorithm is then applied on the adjusted graph, using k -distinct shortest paths as the distance measure. Our framework provides better accuracy compared to MPCK-Means, SS-Kernel-KMeans and Kmeans+Diagonal Metric even when very few constraints are used, significantly improves clustering performance on some datasets that other methods fail to partition successfully, and can cluster both vector and graph datasets.

Theory-Practice Interplay in Machine Learning --- Emerging Theoretical Challenges,Shai Ben-David (University of Waterloo);,2255405445,"Theoretical analysis has played a major role in some of the most prominent practical successes of statistical machine learning. However, mainstream machine learning theory assumes some strong simplifying assumptions which are often unrealistic. In the past decade, the practice of machine learning has led to the development of various heuristic paradigms that answer the needs of a vastly growing range of applications. Many useful such paradigms fall beyond the scope of the currently available analysis. Will theory play a similar pivotal role in the newly emerging sub areas of machine learning?

A simple but notable class of structured prediction is one for sequences, so-called sequential labeling. For sequential labeling, it is often required to take a summation over all the possible output sequences, when estimating the parameters of a probabilistic model for instance. We cannot make the direct calculation of such a summation from its definition in practice. Although the ordinary forward-backward algorithm provides an efficient way to do it, it is applicable to limited types of summations.

A Condensed Representation of Itemsets for Analyzing Their Evolution over Time,Mirko Boettcher;Martin Spott (BT Group);Rudolf Kruse (Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg);,"2148624007,2431366434,2148268392","Driven by the need to understand change within domains there is emerging research on methods which aim at analyzing how patterns and in particular itemsets evolve over time.

As a solution we propose temporally closed itemsets, a novel approach for a condensed representation of itemsets which is based on removing temporal redundancies. We investigate how our approach relates to the well-known concept of closed itemsets if the latter would be directly generalized to account for the temporal dimension.

Efficient Multi-start Strategies for Local Search Algorithms,Levente Kocsis (Hungarian Academy of Sciences);András György (Hungarian Academy of Sciences);,"2026838166,2160942610","Local search algorithms for global optimization often suffer from getting trapped in a local optimum. The common solution for this problem is to restart the algorithm when no progress is observed. Alternatively, one can start multiple instances of a local search algorithm, and allocate computational resources (in particular, processing time) to the instances depending on their behavior. Hence, a multi-start strategy has to decide (dynamically) when to allocate additional resources to a particular instance and when to start new instances. In this paper we propose a consistent multi-start strategy that assumes a convergence rate of the local search algorithm up to an unknown constant, and in every phase gives preference to those instances that could converge to the best value for a particular range of the constant. Combined with the local search algorithm SPSA (Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation), the strategy performs remarkably well in practice, both on synthetic tasks and on tuning the parameters of learning algorithms.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,guided local search;best first search;iterated local search;hill climbing;local search;rate of convergence;search algorithm;global optimization;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematical optimization;mathematics;

The logical constraints deduced from ontologies can be utilized to enhance and control the learning task by enforcing description logic satisfiability in a latent multi-relational graphical model. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach we provide experiments using real world social network data in form of a $\mathcal{SHOIN}(D)$ ontology. The results illustrate two main practical advancements: First, entities and entity relationships can be analyzed via the latent model structure. Second, enforcing the ontological constraints guarantees that the learned model does not predict inconsistent relations.

Relation extraction can be formulated as a classification problem using support vector machines and kernels for structured data that may include parse trees to account for syntactic structure. In this paper we present new tree kernels over dependency parse trees automatically generated from natural language text. Experiments on a public benchmark data set show that our kernels with richer structural features significantly outperform all published approaches for kernel-based relation extraction from dependency trees.

Unfortunately, such decision rules are hardly accessible to humans and cannot easily be used to gain insights about the application domain. Therefore, one often resorts to linear models in combination with variable selection, thereby sacrificing some predictive power for presumptive interpretability. Here, we introduce the Feature Importance Ranking Measure (FIRM), which by retrospective analysis of arbitrary learning machines allows to achieve both excellent predictive performance and superior interpretation. In contrast to standard raw feature weighting, FIRM takes the underlying correlation structure of the features into account. Thereby, it is able to discover the most relevant features, even if their appearance in the training data is entirely prevented by noise. The desirable properties of FIRM are investigated analytically and illustrated in simulations.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,decision rule;feature vector;linear model;feature;feature learning;feature selection;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;
Dynamic Factor Graphs for Time Series Modeling,Piotr W. Mirowski (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences);Yann LeCun (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences);,"2030679600,2053214915","This article presents a method for training Dynamic Factor Graphs (DFG) with continuous latent state variables. A DFG includes factors modeling joint probabilities between hidden and observed variables, and factors modeling dynamical constraints on hidden variables. The DFG assigns a scalar energy to each configuration of hidden and observed variables. A gradient-based inference procedure finds the minimum-energy state sequence for a given observation sequence. Because the factors are designed to ensure a constant partition function, they can be trained by minimizing the expected energy over training sequences with respect to the factors' parameters. These alternated inference and parameter updates can be seen as a deterministic EM-like procedure. Using smoothing regularizers, DFGs are shown to reconstruct chaotic attractors and to separate a mixture of independent oscillatory sources perfectly. DFGs outperform the best known algorithm on the CATS competition benchmark for time series prediction. DFGs also successfully reconstruct missing motion capture data.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,time series;econometrics;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Causality Discovery with Additive Disturbances: An Information-Theoretical Perspective,Kun Zhang (University of Helsinki);Aapo Hyvärinen (University of Helsinki);,"2710299522,2029196934","We consider causally sufficient acyclic causal models in which the relationship among the variables is nonlinear while disturbances have linear effects, and show that three principles, namely, the causal Markov condition (together with the independence between each disturbance and the corresponding parents), minimum disturbance entropy, and mutual independence of the disturbances, are equivalent. This motivates new and more efficient methods for some causal discovery problems. In particular, we propose to use multichannel blind deconvolution, an extension of independent component analysis, to do Granger causality analysis with instantaneous effects. This approach gives more accurate estimates of the parameters and can easily incorporate sparsity constraints. For additive disturbance-based nonlinear causal discovery, we first make use of the conditional independence relationships to obtain the equivalence class; undetermined causal directions are then found by nonlinear regression and pairwise independence tests.

Based on this lower bound, the second phase then processes relevant clusters using the traditional block nested-loop algorithm. Here two efficient pruning rules are utilized to quickly discard more non-outliers and reduce the search space. Detailed analysis of our approach shows that the additional overhead of the first phase is offset by the reduction in cost of the second phase.

An empirical bias/variance analysis as feature selection progresses indicates that the most accurate feature set corresponds to the best bias-variance trade-off point for the learning algorithm. Often, this is not the point separating relevant from irrelevant features, but where increasing variance outweighs the gains from adding more (weakly) relevant features. In other words, feature selection can be viewed as a variance reduction method that trades off the benefits of decreased variance (from the reduction in dimensionality) with the harm of increased bias (from eliminating some of the relevant features). If a variance reduction method like bagging is used, more (weakly) relevant features can be exploited and the most accurate feature set is usually larger. In many cases, the best performance is obtained by using all available features.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,variance reduction;dimensionality reduction;feature;supervised learning;feature selection;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Neural Networks for State Evaluation in General Game Playing,Daniel Michulke (Dresden University of Technology);Michael Thielscher (Dresden University of Technology);,"341748824,279836095","Unlike traditional game playing, General Game Playing is concerned with agents capable of playing classes of games. Given the rules of an unknown game, the agent is supposed to play well without human intervention.

Successful systems of this type use evaluation functions derived solely from the game rules, thus neglecting further improvements by experience. In addition, these functions are fixed in their form and do not necessarily capture the game's real state value function.

Thus, compared to the classical LDA that processes the entire corpus in one, we essentially build separate LDA models for each category with the category-specific topics, and then these topic collections are put together to form a unified LDA model. For an unseen document the inferred topic distribution gives an estimation how much the document fits into the category. We use this method for Web document classification. Our key results are 46% decrease in 1-AUC value in classification accuracy over tf.idf with SVM and 43% over the plain LDA baseline with SVM.

The Model of Most Informative Patterns and Its Application to Knowledge Extraction from Graph Databases,Frédéric Pennerath (Supélec);Amedeo Napoli (Centre national de la recherche scientifique);,"1194141461,2141826860","This article introduces the class of Most Informative Patterns (MIPs) for characterizing a given dataset. MIPs form a reduced subset of non redundant closed patterns that are extracted from data thanks to a scoring function depending on domain knowledge. Accordingly, MIPs are designed for providing experts good insights on the content of datasets during data analysis. The article presents the model of MIPs and their formal properties wrt other kinds of patterns. Then, two algorithms for extracting MIPs are detailed: the first directly searches for MIPs in a dataset while the second screens MIPs from frequent patterns. The efficiencies of both algorithms are compared when applied to reference datasets. Finally the application of MIPs to labelled graphs, here molecular graphs, is discussed.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,score;domain knowledge;data analysis;knowledge extraction;data science;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;statistics;computer science;

Reconstructing Data Perturbed by Random Projections When the Mixing Matrix Is Known,Yingpeng Sang (University of Adelaide);Hong Shen (University of Adelaide);Hui Tian (University of Adelaide);,"2311067965,2194483685,2437049620","Random Projection ($\mathcal{RP}$) has drawn great interest from the research of privacy-preserving data mining due to its high efficiency and security. It was proposed in [27] where the original data set composed of m attributes, is multiplied with a mixing matrix of dimensions k × m ( m > k ) which is random and orthogonal on expectation, and then the k series of perturbed data are released for mining purposes. To our knowledge little work has been done from the view of the attacker, to reconstruct the original data to get some sensitive information, given the data perturbed by $\mathcal{RP}$ and some priori knowledge, e.g. the mixing matrix, the means and variances of the original data. In the case that the attributes of the original data are mutually independent and sparse, the reconstruction can be treated as a problem of Underdetermined Independent Component Analysis (UICA), but UICA has some permutation and scaling ambiguities. In this paper we propose a reconstruction framework based on UICA and also some techniques to reduce the ambiguities. The cases that the attributes of the original data are correlated and not sparse are also common in data mining. We also propose a reconstruction method for the typical case of Multivariate Gaussian Distribution, based on the method of Maximum A Posterior (MAP). Our experiments show that our reconstructions can achieve high recovery rates, and outperform the reconstructions based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA).",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,independent component analysis;maximum a posteriori estimation;principal component analysis;normal distribution;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised and heteroscedastic extension of probabilistic LDA, called S2HPLDA, which aims at overcoming all these limitations under a common principled framework. Moreover, we apply automatic relevance determination to determine the required dimensionality of the low-dimensional space for dimensionality reduction.

On Discriminative Parameter Learning of Bayesian Network Classifiers,Franz Pernkopf (Graz University of Technology);Michael Wohlmayr (Graz University of Technology);,"199276077,199941774","We introduce three discriminative parameter learning algorithms for Bayesian network classifiers based on optimizing either the conditional likelihood (CL) or a lower-bound surrogate of the CL. One training procedure is based on the extended Baum-Welch (EBW) algorithm. Similarly, the remaining two approaches iteratively optimize the parameters (initialized to ML) with a 2-step algorithm. In the first step, either the class posterior probabilities or class assignments are determined based on current parameter estimates. Based on these posteriors (class assignment, respectively), the parameters are updated in the second step. We show that one of these algorithms is strongly related to EBW. Additionally, we compare all algorithms to conjugate gradient conditional likelihood (CGCL) parameter optimization [1]. We present classification results for frame- and segment-based phonetic classification and handwritten digit recognition. Discriminative parameter learning shows a significant improvement over generative ML estimation for naive Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) structures on all data sets.

In this paper, we propose one common solution to cover various scenarios of learning under ""different but related distributions"" in a single framework. Explicit examples include (a) sample selection bias between training and testing data, (b) transfer learning or no labeled data in target domain, and (c) noisy or uncertain training data. The main motivation is that one could ideally solve as many problems as possible with a single approach. The proposed solution extends graph transduction using the maximum margin principle over unlabeled data. The error of the proposed method is bounded under reasonable assumptions even when the training and testing distributions are different. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the traditional graph transduction by as much as 15% in accuracy and AUC in all common situations of distribution difference. Most importantly, it outperforms, by up to 10% in accuracy, several state-of-art approaches proposed to solve specific category of distribution difference, i.e, BRSD [1] for sample selection bias, CDSC [2] for transfer learning, etc. The main claim is that the adaptive graph transduction is a general and competitive method to solve distribution differences implicitly without knowing and worrying about the exact type.

The framework is to decompose one multi-class problem into multiple binary problems and then learn the individual binary classification problems by centroid classifier. However, this kind of decomposition incurs considerable bias for centroid classifier, which results in noticeable degradation of performance for centroid classifier. In order to address this issue, we use Model-Refinement strategy to adjust this so-called bias. The basic idea is to take advantage of misclassified examples in the training data to iteratively refine and adjust the centroids of text data.

Capacity Control for Partially Ordered Feature Sets,Ulrich Rückert (International Computer Science Institute);,2713182964,"Partially ordered feature sets appear naturally in many classification settings with structured input instances, for example, when the data instances are graphs and a feature tests whether a specific substructure occurs in the instance. Since such features are partially ordered according to an ""is substructure of"" relation, the information in those datasets is stored in an intrinsically redundant form. We investigate how this redundancy affects the capacity control behavior of linear classification methods. From a theoretical perspective, it can be shown that the capacity of this hypothesis class does not decrease for worst case distributions. However, if the data generating distribution assigns lower probabilities to instances in the lower levels of the hierarchy induced by the partial order, the capacity of the hypothesis class can be bounded by a smaller term. For itemset, subsequence and subtree features in particular, the capacity is finite even when an infinite number of features is present. We validate these results empirically on three graph datasets and show that the limited capacity of linear classifiers on such data makes underfitting rather than overfitting the more prominent capacity control problem. To avoid underfitting, we propose using more general substructure classes with ""elastic edges"" and we demonstrate how such broad feature classes can be used with large datasets.",2009,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,quantitative structure activity relationship;partially ordered set;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

Cluster analysis is the formal study of algorithms and methods for grouping objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels.

Many of these approaches can be viewed as minimizing a generalized Bregman divergence, and we show that (i) a straightforward alternating projection algorithm can be applied to almost any model in our unified view; (ii) the Hessian for each projection has special structure that makes a Newton projection feasible, even when there are equality constraints on the factors, which allows for matrix co-clustering; and (iii) alternating projections can be generalized to simultaneously factor a set of matrices that share dimensions. These observations immediately yield new optimization algorithms for the above factorization methods, and suggest novel generalizations of these methods such as incorporating row and column biases, and adding or relaxing clustering constraints.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,matrix decomposition;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;
A Fast Algorithm to Find Overlapping Communities in Networks,Steve Gregory (University of Bristol);,2614590065,"Many networks possess a community structure, such that vertices form densely connected groups which are more sparsely linked to other groups. In some cases these groups overlap, with some vertices shared between two or more communities. Discovering communities in networks is a computationally challenging task, especially if they overlap. In previous work we proposed an algorithm, CONGA, that could detect overlapping communities using the new concept of split betweenness . Here we present an improved algorithm based on a local form of betweenness, which yields good results but is much faster. It is especially effective in discovering small-diameter communities in large networks, and has a time complexity of only O( n log n ) for sparse networks.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,girvan newman algorithm;community structure;time complexity;theoretical computer science;combinatorics;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;
Actively Transfer Domain Knowledge,Xiaoxiao Shi (Sun Yat-sen University);Wei Fan (IBM);Jiangtao Ren (Sun Yat-sen University);,"2134782470,2491264568,2170114694","When labeled examples are not readily available, active learning and transfer learning are separate efforts to obtain labeled examples for inductive learning. Active learning asks domain experts to label a small set of examples, but there is a cost incurred for each answer. While transfer learning could borrow labeled examples from a different domain without incurring any labeling cost, there is no guarantee that the transferred examples will actually help improve the learning accuracy. To solve both problems, we propose a framework to actively transfer the knowledge across domains, and the key intuition is to use the knowledge transferred from other domain as often as possible to help learn the current domain, and query experts only when necessary. To do so, labeled examples from the other domain (out-of-domain) are examined on the basis of their likelihood to correctly label the examples of the current domain (in-domain). When this likelihood is low, these out-of-domain examples will not be used to label the in-domain example, but domain experts are consulted to provide class label. We derive a sampling error bound and a querying bound to demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate risk of domain difference by transferring domain knowledge only when they are useful, and query domain experts only when necessary. Experimental studies have employed synthetic datasets and two types of real world datasets, including remote sensing and text classification problems. The proposed method is compared with previously proposed transfer learning and active learning methods. Across all comparisons, the proposed approach can evidently outperform the transfer learning model in classification accuracy given different out-of-domain datasets. For example, upon the remote sensing dataset, the proposed approach achieves an accuracy around 94.5%, while the comparable transfer learning model drops to less than 89% in most cases.

One-Class Classification by Combining Density and Class Probability Estimation,Kathryn Hempstalk (University of Waikato);Eibe Frank (University of Waikato);Ian H. Witten (University of Waikato);,"1782723436,2165714491,2163446563","One-class classification has important applications such as outlier and novelty detection. It is commonly tackled using density estimation techniques or by adapting a standard classification algorithm to the problem of carving out a decision boundary that describes the location of the target data. In this paper we investigate a simple method for one-class classification that combines the application of a density estimator, used to form a reference distribution, with the induction of a standard model for class probability estimation. In this method, the reference distribution is used to generate artificial data that is employed to form a second, artificial class. In conjunction with the target class, this artificial class is the basis for a standard two-class learning problem. We explain how the density function of the reference distribution can be combined with the class probability estimates obtained in this way to form an adjusted estimate of the density function of the target class. Using UCI datasets, and data from a typist recognition problem, we show that the combined model, consisting of both a density estimator and a class probability estimator, can improve on using either component technique alone when used for one-class classification. We also compare the method to one-class classification using support vector machines.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,one class classification;standard model;density estimation;support vector machine;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

In this paper, we introduce Exceptional Model Mining (EMM), a framework that allows for more complicated target concepts. Rather than finding subgroups based on the distribution of a single target attribute, EMM finds subgroups where a model fitted to that subgroup is somehow exceptional. We discuss regression as well as classification models, and define quality measures that determine how exceptional a given model on a subgroup is.

Extracting Semantic Networks from Text Via Relational Clustering,Stanley Kok (University of Washington);Pedro M.

More recently, the availability of large quantities of text on the Web has led to the development of machine learning approaches. However, to date these have mainly extracted ground facts, as opposed to general knowledge. Other learning approaches can extract logical forms, but require supervision and do not scale. In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to extracting semantic networks from large volumes of text. We use the TextRunner system [1] to extract tuples from text, and then induce general concepts and relations from them by jointly clustering the objects and relational strings in the tuples. Our approach is defined in Markov logic using four simple rules. Experiments on a dataset of two million tuples show that it outperforms three other relational clustering approaches, and extracts meaningful semantic networks.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,logical form;semantic network;data mining;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

Efficient Pairwise Multilabel Classification for Large-Scale Problems in the Legal Domain,Eneldo Loza Mencía (Technische Universität Darmstadt);Johannes Fürnkranz (Technische Universität Darmstadt);,"2074138166,52482323","In this paper we applied multilabel classification algorithms to the EUR-Lex database of legal documents of the European Union. On this document collection, we studied three different multilabel classification problems, the largest being the categorization into the EUROVOC concept hierarchy with almost 4000 classes. We evaluated three algorithms: (i) the binary relevance approach which independently trains one classifier per label; (ii) the multiclass multilabel perceptron algorithm, which respects dependencies between the base classifiers; and (iii) the multilabel pairwise perceptron algorithm, which trains one classifier for each pair of labels. All algorithms use the simple but very efficient perceptron algorithm as the underlying classifier, which makes them very suitable for large-scale multilabel classification problems. The main challenge we had to face was that the almost 8,000,000 perceptrons that had to be trained in the pairwise setting could no longer be stored in memory. We solve this problem by resorting to the dual representation of the perceptron, which makes the pairwise approach feasible for problems of this size.

Due to the non monotonicity of the corresponding evaluation functions, standard pruning techniques cannot be used for subgroup discovery, requiring the use of optimistic estimate techniques instead. So far, however, optimistic estimate pruning has only been considered for the extremely simple case of a binary target attribute and up to now no attempt was made to move beyond suboptimal heuristic optimistic estimates. In this paper, we show that optimistic estimate pruning can be developed into a sound and highly effective pruning approach for subgroup discovery. Based on a precise definition of optimality we show that previous estimates have been tight only in special cases. Thereafter, we present tight optimistic estimates for the most popular binary and multi-class quality functions, and present a family of increasingly efficient approximations to these optimal functions.

We propose a modified nearest neighbour algorithm for the construction of monotone classifiers from data. We start by making the training data monotone with as few label changes as possible. The relabeled data set can be viewed as a monotone classifier that has the lowest possible error-rate on the training data. The relabeled data is subsequently used as the training sample by a modified nearest neighbour algorithm. This modified nearest neighbour rule produces predictions that are guaranteed to satisfy the monotonicity constraints. Hence, it is much more likely to be accepted by the intended users.

Rollout Sampling Approximate Policy Iteration,Christos Dimitrakakis (University of Amsterdam);Michail G. Lagoudakis (Technical University of Crete);,"1968011823,268204184","Several researchers [2,3] have recently investigated the connection between reinforcement learning and classification. Our work builds on [2], which suggests an approximate policy iteration algorithm for learning a good policy represented as a classifier, without explicit value function representation. At each iteration, a new policy is produced using training data obtained through rollouts of the previous policy on a simulator. These rollouts aim at identifying better action choices over a subset of states in order to form a set of data for training the classifier representing the improved policy. Even though [2,3] examine how to distribute training states over the state space, their major limitation remains the large amount of sampling employed at each training state. We suggest methods to reduce the number of samples needed to obtain a high-quality training set. This is done by viewing the setting as akin to a bandit problem over the states from which rollouts are performed. Our contribution is two-fold: (a) we suitably adapt existing bandit techniques for rollout management, and (b) we suggest a more appropriate statistical test for identifying states with dominating actions early and with high confidence. Experiments on two classical domains (inverted pendulum, mountain car) demonstrate an improvement in sample complexity that substantially increases the applicability of rollout-based algorithms.

On the base level, we propose an iterative procedure to generate kernels that generalize well on the known datasets. On the meta level, we combine those kernels in a minimization criterion to predict a suitable kernel for the new data.

Typically, Likelihood Ratio (LR) methods are used to estimate the gradient, but they suffer from high variance due to random exploration at every time step of each training episode. Our solution to this problem is to introduce a state-dependent exploration function (SDE) which during an episode returns the same action for any given state. This results in less variance per episode and faster convergence. SDE also finds solutions overlooked by other methods, and even improves upon state-of-the-art gradient estimators such as Natural Actor-Critic. We systematically derive SDE and apply it to several illustrative toy problems and a challenging robotics simulation task, where SDE greatly outperforms random exploration.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,gradient method;likelihood ratio test;reinforcement learning;econometrics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical optimization;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Semi-supervised Laplacian Regularization of Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis,Matthew B. Blaschko (Max Planck Society);Christoph H.

By finding directions that maximize correlation in the space implied by the kernel, KCCA is able to learn representations that are more closely tied to the underlying semantics of the data rather than high variance directions, which are found by PCA but may be the result of noise. However, meaningful directions are not only those that have high correlation to another modality, but also those that capture the manifold structure of the data. We propose a method that is able to simultaneously find highly correlated directions that are also located on high variance directions along the data manifold. This is achieved by the use of semi-supervised Laplacian regularization in the formulation of KCCA, which has the additional benefit of being able to use additional data for which correspondence between the modalities is not known to more robustly estimate the structure of the data manifold. We show experimentally on datasets of images and text that Laplacian regularized training improves the class separation over KCCA with only Tikhonov regularization, while causing no degradation in the correlation between modalities.

Thus, after a tiny investment of human effort, our method allows automatic extraction from potentially thousands of other sites within the same domain. Our approach extends previous methods for detecting data fields in semi-structured web pages by matching those fields to domain schema columns using robust models of data values and contexts.

In this paper we analyse this problem for streams of transaction data from an MDL perspective. Based on this analysis we introduce the StreamKrimp algorithm, whichuses the Krimp algorithm to characterise probability distributions with code tables. With these code tables, StreamKrimp partitions the stream into a sequence of substreams. Each switch of code table indicates a change in the underlying distribution. Experiments on both real and artificial streams show that StreamKrimp detects the changes while using only a very limited amount of data storage.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data stream clustering;data stream mining;world wide web;data mining;database;computer science;

Though most current traffic lights use simple heuristic protocols, more efficient controllers can be discovered automatically via multiagent reinforcement learning, where each agent controls a single traffic light. However, in previous work on this approach, agents select only locally optimal actions without coordinating their behavior. This paper extends this approach to include explicit coordination between neighboring traffic lights. Coordination is achieved using the max-plus algorithm, which estimates the optimal joint action by sending locally optimized messages among connected agents. This paper presents the first application of max-plus to a large-scale problem and thus verifies its efficacy in realistic settings. It also provides empirical evidence that max-plus performs well on cyclic graphs, though it has been proven to converge only for tree-structured graphs. Furthermore, it provides a new understanding of the properties a traffic network must have for such coordination to be beneficial and shows that max-plus outperforms previous methods on networks that possess those properties.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,tree structure;empirical evidence;reinforcement learning;distributed computing;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation;computer science;

In this paper, we introduce the concept of local user similarity and global user similarity, based on surprisal-based vector similarity and the application of the concept of maximin distance in graph theory. Surprisal-based vector similarity expresses the relationship between any two users based on the quantities of information (called surprisal) contained in their ratings, which is based on the intuition that less common ratings for a specific item tend to provide more discriminative information than the most common ratings. Furthermore, traditional methods of computing user similarity can not work if two users have not rated any identical item. To solve this problem, the global user similarity is introduced to define two users being similar if they can be connected through their locally similar neighbors. A weighted user graph is first constructed by using local similarity of any two users as the weight of the edge connecting them. Then the global similarity can be calculated as the maximin distance of any two nodes in the graph. Based on both of Local User Similarity and Global User Similarity, we develop a collaborative filtering framework called LS&GS.

Unsupervised Riemannian Clustering of Probability Density Functions,Alvina Goh (Johns Hopkins University);René Vidal (Johns Hopkins University);,"2291811738,2155853947","We present an algorithm for grouping families of probability density functions (pdfs). We exploit the fact that under the square-root re-parametrization, the space of pdfs forms a Riemannian manifold, namely the unit Hilbert sphere. An immediate consequence of this re-parametrization is that different families of pdfs form different submanifolds of the unit Hilbert sphere. Therefore, the problem of clustering pdfs reduces to the problem of clustering multiple submanifolds on the unit Hilbert sphere. We solve this problem by first learning a low-dimensional representation of the pdfs using generalizations of local nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms from Euclidean to Riemannian spaces. Then, by assuming that the pdfs from different groups are separated, we show that the null space of a matrix built from the local representation gives the segmentation of the pdfs.

We propose a deconvolution approach to estimate the individual contributions of each source to a given data item. Similarly, the distributions of multi-label data are computed based on the source distributions. In experiments with synthetic data, the novel approach is compared to existing models and yields more accurate parameter estimates, higher classification accuracy and ameliorated generalization to previously unseen label sets.

A Critical Analysis of Variants of the AUC,Stijn Vanderlooy (Maastricht University);Eyke Hüllermeier (University of Marburg);,"1130404274,323026139","The area under the ROC curve, or AUC, has been widely used to assess the ranking performance of binary scoring classifiers. Given a sample of labeled instances, the metric considers the number of correctly ordered pairs of instances with different class label. Thus, its value only depends on the ordering of the scores but not on the ""margin"" between them. Consequently, it can happen that a small change in scores leads to a considerable change in AUC value. Such an effect is especially apparent when the number of instances used to calculate the AUC is small. On the other hand, two classifiers can have the same AUC value, even though one of them is a ""better separator"" in the sense that it increases the difference between scores of positive and negative instances, respectively. It has been argued that this insensitivity toward score differences is disadvantageous for model evaluation and selection. For this reason, three variants of the AUC metric that take the score differences into account have recently been proposed, along with first experimental results. We present a unifying framework in which the conventional AUC and its variants can be modeled as special cases of a generalized AUC metric. Within this framework, we provide a formal analysis showing that the AUC variants produce estimates of the true AUC with a non-constant, model-specific bias, while the variance can decrease as well as increase. All things considered, the net effect on the quality of the estimations is thus not clear and, hereby, there is no solid theoretical foundation for the variants. Our analysis leads us to conjecture that actually none of the variants should be able to perform better in model selection than conventional AUC. This conjecture is corroborated by extensive experiments with synthetic data as well as real benchmark data, showing that the conventional AUC cannot be outperformed systematically by any variant, not in an ideal setting according to the theoretical analysis, and not in real model selection scenarios. Finally, our contribution also sheds light on recent research dealing with the construction of classifiers that (approximately) optimize the AUC directly, rather than accuracy or another performance metric.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,receiver operating characteristic;econometrics;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

We hence systematically study how well schemes for sparse high-dimensional data adapt to the much denser representations gained by random hyperplane hashing, how much data has to be transmitted to preserve enough of the semantics of each document, and how the representations affect the overall computational complexity.

CMA returns an indeterminate classification, i.e., multiple classes, on the instances for which the learning set is not informative enough to smooth the effect of the choice of the prior. We give an algorithm to compute exact credal model averaging for naive networks. Extensive experiments show that indeterminate classifications preserve the reliability of CMA on the instances which are classified in a prior-dependent way by BMA.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,imprecise probability;naive bayes classifier;bayesian network;biological classification;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

We start by showing a negative example: in the context of frequent sequences, the notion of non-derivability is meaningless . This negative result motivated us to look at a slightly different problem: the mining of conjunctions of sequential patterns. This extended class of patterns turns out to have much nicer mathematical properties. For example, for this class of patterns we are able to extend the notion of non-derivable itemsets in a non-trivial way, based on a new unexploited theoretical definition of equivalence classes for sequential patterns. As a side-effect of considering conjunctions of sequences as the pattern type, we can easily form association rules between sequences. We believe that building a theoretical framework and an efficient approach for sequence association rules extraction problem is the first step toward the generalization of association rules to all complex and ordered patterns.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;machine learning;algorithm;mathematics;

However, choosing an appropriate distance function for k -NN can be challenging and an inferior choice can make the classifier highly vulnerable to noise in the data. In this paper, we propose a new method for determining a good distance function for k -NN. Our method is based on consideration of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, which is a well known method to measure the quality of binary classifiers. It computes weights for the distance function, based on ROC properties within an appropriate neighbourhood for the instances whose distance is being computed. We experimentally compare the effect of our scheme with a number of other well-known k -NN distance metrics, as well as with a range of different classifiers. Experiments show that our method can substantially boost the classification performance of the k -NN algorithm. Furthermore, in a number of cases our technique is even able to deliver better accuracy than state-of-the-art non k -NN classifiers, such as support vector machines.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,receiver operating characteristic;metric;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

We utilize unlabeled data to maximize an optimality criterion of LDA and use the constrained concave-convex procedure to solve the optimization problem. The optimization procedure leads to estimation of the class labels for the unlabeled data. We propose a novel confidence measure for selecting those unlabeled data points with high confidence. The selected unlabeled data can then be used to augment the original labeled data set for performing LDA.

Decomposable Families of Itemsets,Nikolaj Tatti (Helsinki University of Technology);Hannes Heikinheimo (Helsinki University of Technology);,"1367500519,2106377507","The problem of selecting a small, yet high quality subset of patterns from a larger collection of itemsets has recently attracted a lot of research. Here we discuss an approach to this problem using the notion of decomposable families of itemsets. Such itemset families define a probabilistic model for the data from which the original collection of itemsets was derived. Furthermore, they induce a special tree structure, called a junction tree, familiar from the theory of Markov Random Fields. The method has several advantages. The junction trees provide an intuitive representation of the mining results. From the computational point of view, the model provides leverage for problems that could be intractable using the entire collection of itemsets.

From Microscopy Images to Models of Cellular Processes,"Yoav Freund (University of California, San Diego);",2021686850,"The advance of fluorescent tagging and of confocal microscopy is allowing biologists to image biochemical processes at a level of detail that was unimaginable just a few years ago. However, as the analysis of these images is done mostly by hand, there is a severe bottleneck in transforming these images into useful quantitative data that can be used to evaluate mathematical models. One of the inherent challenges involved in automating this transformation is that image data is highly variable. This requires a recalibration of the image processing algorithms for each experiment. We use machine learning methods to enable the experimentalist to calibrate the image processing methods without having any knowledge of how these methods work. This, we believe, will allow the rapid integration of computer vision methods with confocal microscopy and open the way to the development of quantitative spatial models of cellular processes.

In this work we study the problem of continuously maintain a cluster structure over the data points generated by the entire network. Usual techniques operate by forwarding and concentrating the entire data in a central server, processing it as a multivariate stream. In this paper, we propose DGClust , a new distributed algorithm which reduces both the dimensionality and the communication burdens, by allowing each local sensor to keep an online discretization of its data stream, which operates with constant update time and (almost) fixed space. Each new data point triggers a cell in this univariate grid, reflecting the current state of the data stream at the local site. Whenever a local site changes its state, it notifies the central server about the new state it is in. This way, at each point in time, the central site has the global multivariate state of the entire network. To avoid monitoring all possible states, which is exponential in the number of sensors, the central site keeps a small list of counters of the most frequent global states. Finally, a simple adaptive partitional clustering algorithm is applied to the frequent states central points in order to provide an anytime definition of the clusters centers.

For example, each value observed at a given time-stamp from environmental sensors may have an associated type (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc) as well as location. Time-stamp, type and location are the three aspects, which can be modeled using a tensor (high-order array). However, the time aspect is special, with a natural ordering, and with successive time-ticks having usually correlated values. Standard multiway analysis ignores this structure. To capture it, we propose 2 Heads Tensor Analysis (2-heads), which provides a qualitatively different treatment on time. Unlike most existing approaches that use a PCA-like summarization scheme for all aspects, 2-heads treats the time aspect carefully. 2-heads combines the power of classic multilinear analysis (PARAFAC [1], Tucker [5], DTA/STA [3], WTA [2]) with wavelets, leading to a powerful mining tool. Furthermore, 2-heads has several other advantages as well: (a) it can be computed incrementally in a streaming fashion, (b) it has a provable error guarantee and, (c) it achieves significant compression ratio against competitors. Finally, we show experiments on real datasets, and we illustrate how 2-heads reveals interesting trends in the data.

The trace norm of the so-called covariance operator in feature space is used to measure the prediction error. Relying on this measure, we test the improvement of predictability between time series by subsampling-based multiple testing.

To select models with the best future classification performance measured by a goal metric , an evaluation metric is often used to select the best classification model among the competing ones. A common practice is to use the same goal and evaluation metric. However, in several recent studies, it is claimed that using an evaluation metric (such as AUC) other than the goal metric (such as accuracy) results in better selection of the correct models. In this paper, we point out a flaw in the experimental design of those studies, and propose an improved method to test the claim.

In building systems for estimating sales opportunity, the key issues are: (a) predictions for targets that cannot be verified, (b) explanatory capabilities (c) capability to incorporate external knowledge (d) parallel computation of multiple targets and other efficiencies (e) capability to calibrate optimism in the predictions.

Some example applications are: (i) analysis of microarray data in bioinformatics, (ii) pattern discovery in social networks, (iii) analysis of transportation networks, (iv) community discovery in Web data. Existing pattern discovery approaches operate by using simple constraints on the mined patterns. For example, given a database of graphs, a typical graph mining task is to report all subgraphs that appear in at least s graphs, where s is the frequency support threshold. In other cases, we are interested in the discovery of dense or highly-connected subgraphs. In such a case, a threshold is defined for the density or the connectivity of the returned patterns. Other constraints may be defined as well, towards restricting the number of mined patterns. There are three important limitations with this approach: (i) there is an on-off decision regarding the eligibility of patterns, i.e., a pattern either satisfies the constraints or not, (ii) in the case where the constraints are very strict we risk an empty answer or an answer with only a few patterns, and (iii) in the case where the constraints are too weak the number of patterns may be huge.",2008,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

"Industrializing Data Mining, Challenges and Perspectives",Françoise Fogelman-Soulié (KXEN Inc.);,2417038387,"Business Intelligence is a very active sector in all industrial domains. Classical techniques (reporting and Olap), mainly concerned with presenting data, are already widely deployed.

But with the increasing availability of large data volumes (in particular, but not only, from theWeb), companies are more and more turning to data mining to provide them with high added-value predictive analytics. However producing models in large numbers, making use of large data volumes in an industrial context can only happen if solutions to challenges, both theoretic and operational, are found: we need algorithms which can be used to produce models when datasets have thousands of variables and millions of observations; we need to learn how to run and control the correct execution of hundreds of models; we need ways to automate the data mining process.

A Space Efficient Solution to the Frequent String Mining Problem for Many Databases,Adrian Kügel (University of Ulm);Enno Ohlebusch (University of Ulm);,"2069706914,315454154","In the frequent string mining problem, one is given m databases ${\cal D}_1,...,{\cal D}_m$ of strings and searches for strings that fulfill certain frequency constraints.

Incremental Exemplar Learning Schemes for Classification on Embedded Devices,Ankur Jain (Mitsubishi Electric);Daniel Nikovski (Mitsubishi Electric);,"2618198558,2437424207","In this paper, we focus on the data classification problem when the classifier operates on an embedded device (e.g., fault detection in device condition-monitoring data streams). Memory-based classifiers are an excellent choice in such cases, however, an embedded device is unlikely to be able to hold a large training dataset in memory (which could potentially keep increasing in size as new training data with new concepts arrive). A viable option then is to employ exemplar learning (EL) techniques to find a training subset comprising a few carefully selected exemplars of high functional value that fit in memory and effectively delineate the class boundaries. We propose two novel incremental EL schemes that unlike traditional EL approaches [3] are, (1) incremental (they naturally incorporate new training data streams), (2) offer ordered removal of instances (they can be customized to obtain exemplar sets of any user-defined size) and (3) robust (such that the exemplar sets generalize for other classifiers as well). Our proposed methods are as follows: EBEL (Entropy Based EL) --- This method removes instances from the training set based on their information content . Instead of using an adhoc ranking scheme, it removes a training instance whose removal causes the least amount of drop in the conditional entropy of the class indicator variable insuring minimum loss of information. ABEL (AUC Based EL) --- This method prunes data based on AUC (Area under ROC curve) performance. ABEL uses a validation set and prunes an instance if its removal offers the least drop in the AUC computed for this validation set. We show that our schemes efficiently incorporate new training datasets while maintaining high-quality exemplar sets of any user-defined size.

New closed-form bounds on the partition function,Dvijotham Krishnamurthy (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay);Soumen Chakrabarti (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay);Subhasis Chaudhuri (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay);,"2280118805,2103349674,2099444079","Estimating the partition function is a key computation in graphical models that is required for important tasks like parameter estimation, model selection and structure learning. However, this computation is intractable in general. Thus, developing efficient and accurate approximations is of considerable interest. Variational methods express the computation of the partition function as an optimization problem (solving which intractable in general) and then relax the optimization problem in various ways to obtain approximations to the partition function. Two popular algorithms belonging to this framework are loopy belief propagation (LBP) and tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRW-BP). Both these algorithms are so-called message passing algorithms that work by updating local beliefs about probabilities at graph nodes by passing messages between the nodes in the graph until convergence is achieved. TRW-BP is guaranteed to give an upper bound on the partition function. However, neither algorithm is guaranteed to converge in general. Although convergent alternatives to TRW-BP have been proposed, they have no guarantees on the number of iterations required for convergence. Thus, these algorithms could be prohibitively expensive for applications requiring repeated inference on large graphs (like training large CRFs). In order to overcome this problem, Sutton et al. propose the piecewise approximation (PW) to the partition function. PW tends to be loose, but can be computed very fast, because it has a closed-form expression. Sutton et al. apply it successfully to common NLP tasks. In this paper, for a special class of potentials (that contain associative potentials), we prove that both LBP and TRW-BP converge in a single iteration. Using this fact, we obtain closed-form expressions for the TRW and LBP approximations to the partition function. In recent work, Wainwright et al. prove that LBP gives a lower bound on the partition function for binary attractive MRFs. We thus also get closed-form lower bounds for attractive associative MRFs. This enables us to obtain bounds on the error between the true partition function and these approximations for attractive associative MRFs. We also construct examples which show that TRW and LBP can give arbitrarily bad approximations to the marginal probabilities. Using the closed-form bounds for these special cases, we also develop novel closed-form upper bounds for arbitrary MRFs and closed-form lower bounds for associative binary MRFs.

Efficient Weight Learning for Markov Logic Networks,Daniel Lowd (University of Washington);Pedro M.

Unfortunately, these can vary widely between clauses, causing the learning problem to be highly ill-conditioned, and making gradient descent very slow. In this paper, we explore several alternatives, from per-weight learning rates to second-order methods.

However, many applications, such as gene functional prediction and text categorization, may allow the instances to be associated with multiple labels simultaneously. Multi-label classification is a generalization of single-label classification, and its generality makes it much more difficult to solve. Despite its importance, research on multi-label classification is still lacking. Common approaches simply learn independent binary classifiers for each label, and do not exploit dependencies among labels. Also, several small disjuncts may appear due to the possibly large number of label combinations, and neglecting these small disjuncts may degrade classification accuracy. In this paper we propose a multi-label lazy associative classifier, which progressively exploits dependencies among labels. Further, since in our lazy strategy the classification model is induced on an instance-based fashion, the proposed approach can provide a better coverage of small disjuncts. Gains of up to 24% are observed when the proposed approach is compared against the state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers.",2007,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,one class classification;data mining;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

Using the Web to Reduce Data Sparseness in Pattern-Based Information Extraction,Sebastian Blohm (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology);Philipp Cimiano (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology);,"2145688870,2086393978","Textual patterns have been used effectively to extract information from large text collections. However they rely heavily on textual redundancy in the sense that facts have to be mentioned in a similar manner in order to be generalized to a textual pattern. Data sparseness thus becomes a problem when trying to extract information from hardly redundant sources like corporate intranets, encyclopedic works or scientific databases. We present results on applying a weakly supervised pattern induction algorithm to Wikipedia to extract instances of arbitrary relations. In particular, we apply different configurations of a basic algorithm for pattern induction on seven different datasets. We show that the lack of redundancy leads to the need of a large amount of training data but that integrating Web extraction into the process leads to a significant reduction of required training data while maintaining the accuracy of Wikipedia. In particular we show that, though the use of the Web can have similar effects as produced by increasing the number of seeds, it leads overall to better results.

Recently, AUC gained importance in the classification community as a mean to compare the performance of classifiers. Because most classification methods do not optimize this measure directly, several classification learning methods are emerging that directly optimize the AUC. These methods, however, require many costly computations of the AUC, and hence, do not scale well to large datasets. In this paper, we develop a method to increase the efficiency of computing AUC based on a polynomial approximation of the AUC. As a proof of concept, the approximation is plugged into the construction of a scalable linear classifier that directly optimizes AUC using a gradient descent method.

In working toward a solution of the problem of the classification of perceptual objects, this article introduces a near set approach to feature selection. Consideration of the nearness of objects has recently led to the introduction of what are known as near sets, an optimist's view of the approximation of sets of objects that are more or less near each other. Near set theory started with the introduction of collections of partitions (families of neighbourhoods) that provide a basis for a feature selection method based on the information content of the partitions of a set of sample objects. A byproduct of the proposed approach is a feature filtering method that eliminates features that are less useful in the classification of objects.

We consider the approach as being a first step towards a generic method that provides for classifying a broad range of seismic patterns by modeling the interrelationships between essential features of seismograms in a graphical model. Through a continuous Wavelet transform the features are extracted, yielding a time-frequency-amplitude decomposition. The extracted features obey certain Markov properties, which allows us to form a joint distribution in terms of a Dynamic Bayesian Network. We performed experiments using real seismic data recorded at different stations in the European Broadband Network, for which we achieve an average classification accuracy of 95%.",2007,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,variable order bayesian network;dynamic bayesian network;markov property;continuous wavelet transform;broadband networks;graphical model;time frequency analysis;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;computer science;
Expectation Propagation for Rating Players in Sports Competitions,Adriana Birlutiu (Radboud University Nijmegen);Tom Heskes (Radboud University Nijmegen);,"1603574922,2017622874","Rating players in sports competitions based on game results is one example of paired comparison data analysis. Since an exact Bayesian treatment is intractable, several techniques for approximate inference have been proposed in the literature. In this paper we compare several variants of expectation propagation (EP). EP generalizes assumed density filtering (ADF) by iteratively improving the approximations that are made in the filtering step of ADF. Furthermore, we distinguish between two variants of EP: EP-Correlated, which takes into account the correlations between the strengths of the players and EP-Independent, which ignores those correlations. We evaluate the different approaches on a large tennis dataset to find that EP does significantly better than ADF (iterative improvement indeed helps) and EP-Correlated does significantly better than EP-Independent (correlations do matter).",2007,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,pairwise comparison;prior probability;posterior probability;covariance matrix;data analysis;econometrics;data mining;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;

To address this problem, we present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that shares information between features by modeling similarities between their parameters. We believe this approach is applicable to many sparse, high dimensional problems and especially relevant to those with both spatial and temporal components.

On the other hand, we sometimes employ traditional analytical methods in the field of social network analysis using e.g., centrality measures, structural holes, and network clustering. Through this study, we seek to bridge the gap between the aggregated features from the network data and traditional indices used in social network analysis. The notable feature of our algorithm is the ability to invent several indices that are well studied in sociology. We first define general operators that are applicable to an adjacent network.

Of the many approaches proposed, most rely on the assumption of operating within the confines of a single website or require expensive hand-labeling of relevant and non-relevant blocks for model induction. This reduces their applicability, since in many practical scenarios template blocks need to be detected in arbitrary web pages, with no prior knowledge of the site structure. In this work we propose to bridge these two approaches by using within-site template discovery techniques to drive the induction of a site-independent template detector.

For each Web database, query terms are selected from the class features based on their weights. A hidden-web database is then probed by analyzing the results of the class-specific query. To raise the performance further, we also use Web pages which have links pointing to the hidden-web database (HW-DB) as another important source to represent the database. We combine link-based evaluation and query-based probing as our final classification solution. The experiment shows that the combined method can produce much better performance for classification of hidden Web Databases.",2007,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data web;web mapping;web search query;web query classification;decision tree learning;web page;library classification;deep web;web mining;world wide web;information retrieval;data mining;computer science;
Putting Things in Order: On the Fundamental Role of Ranking in Classification and Probability Estimation,Peter A. Flach (University of Bristol);,1814273096,"While a binary classifier aims to distinguish positives from negatives, a ranker orders instances from high to low expectation that the instance is positive. Most classification models in machine learning output some score of `positiveness', and hence can be used as rankers. Conversely, any ranker can be turned into a classifier if we have some instance-independent means of splitting the ranking into positive and negative segments. This could be a fixed score threshold; a point obtained from fixing the slope on the ROC curve; the break-even point between true positive and true negative rates; to mention just a few possibilities. These connections between ranking and classification notwithstanding, there are considerable differences as well. Classification performance on n examples is measured by accuracy, an O ( n ) operation; ranking performance, on the other hand, is measured by the area under the ROC curve (AUC), an O ( n log n ) operation. The model with the highest AUC does not necessarily dominate all other models, and thus it is possible that another model would achieve a higher accuracy for certain operating conditions, even if its AUC is lower. However, within certain model classes good ranking performance and good classification performance are more closely related than suggested by the previous remarks. For instance, there is evidence that certain classification models, while designed to optimise accuracy, in effect optimise an AUC-based loss function [1]. It has also been known for some time that decision tree yield convex training set ROC curves by construction [2], and thus optimising training set accuracy is likely to lead to good training set AUC. In this talk I will investigate the relation between ranking and classification more closely. I will also consider the connection between ranking and probability estimation. The quality of probability estimates can be measured by, e.g., mean squared error in the probability estimates (the Brier score). However, like accuracy, this is an O ( n ) operation that doesn't fully take ranking performance into account. I will show how a novel decomposition of the Brier score into calibration loss and refinement loss [3] sheds light on both ranking and probability estimation performance. While previous decompositions are approximate [4], our decomposition is an exact one based on the ROC convex hull. (The connection between the ROC convex hull and calibration was independently noted by [5]). In the case of decision trees, the analysis explains the empirical evidence that probability estimation trees produce well-calibrated probabilities [6].",2007,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,operant conditioning;receiver operating characteristic;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;
Classification of Web Documents Using a Graph-Based Model and Structural Patterns,Andrzej Dominik (Warsaw University of Technology);Zbigniew Walczak (Warsaw University of Technology);Jacek Wojciechowski (Warsaw University of Technology);,"2150455711,1957483854,2028160399","The problem of classifying web documents is studied in this paper. A graph-based instead of traditional vector-based model is used for document representation. A novel classification algorithm which uses two different types of structural patterns (subgraphs): contrast and common is proposed. This approach is strongly associated with the classical emerging patterns techniques known from decision tables. The presented method is evaluated on three different benchmark web documents collections for measuring classification accuracy. Results show that it can outperform other existing algorithms (based on vector, graph, and hybrid document representation) in terms of accuracy and document model complexity.

Discovery of frequent graph patterns that consist of the vertices with the complex structures,Tsubasa Yamamoto (Kobe University);Tomonobu Ozaki (Kobe University);Takenao Ohkawa (Kobe University);,"2487032218,2129186553,2296788610","In some real world applications, the data can be represented naturally in a special kind of graphs in which each vertex consists of a set of (structured) data such as item sets, sequences and so on.

We call this kind of complex graphs multi-structured graphs. In this paper, we propose an algorithm named FMG for mining frequent patterns in multistructured graphs. In FMG, while the external structure will be expanded by the same mechanism of conventional graph miners, the internal structure will be enumerated by the algorithms suitable for its structure.

Pruning Relations for Substructure Discovery of Multi-relational Databases,Hongyu Guo (University of Ottawa);Herna L. Viktor (University of Ottawa);Eric Paquet (National Research Council);,"2131034304,2091794408,1278008176","Multirelational data mining methods discover patterns across multiple interlinked tables (relations) in a relational database. In many large organizations, such a multi-relational database spans numerous departments and/or subdivisions, which are involved in different aspects of the enterprise such as customer profiling, fraud detection, inventory management, financial management, and so on. When considering multirelational classification, it follows that these subdivisions will express different interests in the data, leading to the need to explore various subsets of relevant relations with high utility with respect to the target class. The paper presents a novel approach for pruning the uninteresting relations of a relational database where relations come from such different parties and spans many classification tasks. We aim to create a pruned structure and thus minimize predictive performance loss on the final classification model. Our method identifies a set of strongly uncorrelated subgraphs to use for training and discards all others. The experiments performed demonstrate that our strategy is able to significantly reduce the size of the relational schema without sacrificing predictive accuracy.",2007,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,database design;relational model;relational database;financial management;data science;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;

Adventures in Personalized Information Access,Barry Smyth (University College Dublin);,2133336528,"Access to information plays an increasingly important role in our everyday lives and we have come to rely more and more on a variety of information access services to bring us the right information at the right time. Recently the traditional one-size-fits-all approach, which has informed the development of the majority of today's information access services, from search engines to portals, has been brought in to question as researchers consider the advantages of more personalized services. Such services can respond to the learned needs and preferences of individuals and groups of like-minded users. They provide for a more proactive model of information supply in place of today's reactive models of information search. In this talk we will consider the key challenges that motivate the need for a new generation of personalized information services, as well as the pitfalls that lie in wait.

Learning Multi-dimensional Functions: Gas Turbine Engine Modeling,Chris Drummond (National Research Council);,1984169687,"This paper shows how multi-dimensional functions, describing the operation of complex equipment, can be learned.

The prototypical function and the space's dimensions, which define morphological operations, are learned from a set of existing functions. New ones are generated by averaging the coordinates of similar functions and using these to morph the prototype appropriately.

Learning to order: a relational approach,Donato Malerba (University of Bari);Michelangelo Ceci (University of Bari);,"2360612151,2114873949","In some applications it is necessary to sort a set of elements according to an order relationship which is not known a priori. In these cases, a training set of ordered elements is often available, from which the order relationship can be automatically learned. In this work, it is assumed that the correct succession of elements in a training sequence (or chain) is given, so that it is possible to induce the definition of two predicates, first/1 and succ/2, which are then used to establish an ordering relationship. A peculiarity of this work is the relational representation of training data which allows various relationships between ordered elements to be expressed in addition to the ordering relationship. Therefore, an ILP learning algorithm is applied to induce the definitions of the two predicates. Two methods are reported for the identification of either single chains or multiple chains on new objects.

Tractable models for information diffusion in social networks,Masahiro Kimura (Ryukoku University);Kazumi Saito (University of Shizuoka);,"1989850375,2171394160","When we consider the problem of finding influential nodes for information diffusion in a large-scale social network based on the Independent Cascade Model (ICM), we need to compute the expected number of nodes influenced by a given set of nodes. However, a good estimate of this quantity needs a large amount of computation in the ICM. In this paper, we propose two natural special cases of the ICM such that a good estimate of this quantity can be efficiently computed. Using real large-scale social networks, we experimentally demonstrate that for extracting influential nodes, the proposed models can provide novel ranking methods that are different from the ICM, typical methods of social network analysis, and “PageRank” method. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that when the propagation probabilities through links are small, they can give good approximations to the ICM for finding sets of influential nodes.",2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,social network analysis;network analysis;social network;systems modeling;knowledge extraction;data mining;artificial intelligence;computer science;

Previous empirical work has convincingly shown that adding constraints to clustering improves performance, with respect to the true data labels. However, in most of these experiments, results are averaged over different randomly chosen constraint sets, thereby masking interesting properties of individual sets. We demonstrate that constraint sets vary significantly in how useful they are for constrained clustering; some constraint sets can actually decrease algorithm performance. We create two quantitative measures, informativeness and coherence, that can be used to identify useful constraint sets. We show that these measures can also help explain differences in performance for four particular constrained clustering algorithms.",2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,canopy clustering algorithm;correlation clustering;constrained clustering;data stream clustering;cure data clustering algorithm;fuzzy clustering;cluster analysis;knowledge extraction;information extraction;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

The distance metric between papers used in DBSCAN is calculated by an online active selection support vector machine algorithm (LASVM), yielding a simpler model, lower test errors and faster prediction time than a standard SVM. We prove that by recasting transitivity as density reachability in DBSCAN, transitivity is guaranteed for core points.

In this paper we propose a novel method, 2-Level Fraud Spotting (2LFS), to model the techniques that fraudsters typically use to carry out fraudulent activities, and to detect fraudsters preemptively. Our key contributions are: (a) we mine user level features (e.g., number of transactions, average price of goods exchanged, etc.) to get an initial belief for spotting fraudsters, (b) we introduce network level features which capture the interactions between different users, and (c) we show how to combine both these features using a Belief Propagation algorithm over a Markov Random Field, and use it to detect suspicious patterns (e.g., unnaturally close-nit groups of people that trade mainly among themselves). Our algorithm scales linearly with the number of graph edges.

Naive bayes for text classification with unbalanced classes,Eibe Frank (University of Waikato);Remco R. Bouckaert (University of Waikato);,"2165714491,219893367","Multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) is a popular method for document classification due to its computational efficiency and relatively good predictive performance. It has recently been established that predictive performance can be improved further by appropriate data transformations [1,2]. In this paper we present another transformation that is designed to combat a potential problem with the application of MNB to unbalanced datasets. We propose an appropriate correction by adjusting attribute priors. This correction can be implemented as another data normalization step, and we show that it can significantly improve the area under the ROC curve. We also show that the modified version of MNB is very closely related to the simple centroid-based classifier and compare the two methods empirically.",2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data transformation;center of mass;naive bayes classifier;war;receiver operating characteristic;natural language;biological classification;knowledge extraction;content analysis;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
An attacker's view of distance preserving maps for privacy preserving data mining,"Kun Liu (University of Maryland, Baltimore County);Chris Giannella (University of Maryland, Baltimore County);Hillol Kargupta (University of Maryland, Baltimore County);","2144142685,2336552136,539587773","We examine the effectiveness of distance preserving transformations in privacy preserving data mining. These techniques are potentially very useful in that some important data mining algorithms can be efficiently applied to the transformed data and produce exactly the same results as if applied to the original data e.g. distance-based clustering, k-nearest neighbor classification. However, the issue of how well the original data is hidden has, to our knowledge, not been carefully studied. We take a step in this direction by assuming the role of an attacker armed with two types of prior information regarding the original data. We examine how well the attacker can recover the original data from the transformed data and prior information.

Our approach combines three methodological ingredients: learning from background corpora, latent variable models for decomposing the topic-word space into topic-concept and concept-word spaces, and explicit knowledge models (light-weight ontologies, thesauri, e.g. WordNet) with named concepts for populating latent variables. The combination has synergies that can boost the combined performance. This paper presents the theoretical model and extensive experimental results on three data collections.

We compare learning a single HMC tree (which makes predictions for all classes together) to learning a set of regular classification trees (one for each class). Interestingly, on all 12 datasets we use, the HMC tree wins on all fronts: it is faster to learn and to apply, easier to interpret, and has similar or better predictive performance than the set of regular trees. It turns out that HMC tree learning is more robust to overfitting than regular tree learning.",2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,incremental decision tree;empirical research;knowledge extraction;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Decomposition methods have been studied extensively, but many methods return real-valued matrices. If the original data is binary, the interpretation of the basis vectors is hard. We describe a matrix decomposition formulation, the Discrete Basis Problem. The problem seeks for a Boolean decomposition of a binary matrix, thus allowing the user to easily interpret the basis vectors. We show that the problem is computationally difficult and give a simple greedy algorithm for solving it. We present experimental results for the algorithm. The method gives intuitively appealing basis vectors. On the other hand, the continuous decomposition methods often give better reconstruction accuracies.

In 2005, Stanford won the challenge and the $2M prize money by successfully traversing the course in less than 7 hours. This talk, delivered by the leader of the Stanford Racing Team, will provide insights in the software architecture of Stanford's winning robot. The robot massively relied on machine learning and probabilistic modeling for sensor interpretation, and robot motion planning algorithms for vehicle guidance and control.

This trade-off is investigated in the context of correlated pattern mining, which is concerned with finding the k-best patterns according to a convex criterion, for the pattern languages of itemsets, multi-itemsets, sequences, trees and graphs. The criteria used in our investigation are the typical ones in data mining: computational cost and predictive accuracy and the domain is that of mining molecular graph databases. More specifically, we provide empirical answers to the following questions: how does the expressive power of the language affect the computational cost? and what is the trade-off between expressiveness of the pattern language and the predictive accuracy of the learned model? While answering the first question, we also introduce a novel stepwise approach to correlated pattern mining in which the results of mining a simpler pattern language are employed as a starting point for mining in a more complex one.

Frequent item set mining attempts this, but low support levels often result in exorbitant amounts of item sets. Recently we showed that by using MDL we are able to select a small number of item sets that compress the data well [11]. Here we show that this small set is a good approximation of the underlying data distribution. Using the small set in a MDL-based classifier leads to performance on par with well-known rule-induction and association-rule based methods. Advantages are that no parameters need to be set manually and only very few item sets are used.

In contrast to the presented result for strings, no optimal algorithms are known for other pattern domains such as itemsets. The key to our approach are several recent results on index structures for strings, among them suffix- and lcp-arrays, and a new preprocessing scheme for range minimum queries.

Most existing works on community discovery generate a partition of the entity network, assuming each entity belongs to one community. However, in the scenario of named entities, an entity may participate in several communities. For example, a person is in the communities of his/her family, colleagues, and friends.

We show that this refinement improves the functional modularity of the PPI graph and leads to effective clustering into dense components. A detailed comparison of these dense components with the ones obtained from the original PPI graph reveal three major benefits of the refinement: i) Enhancement of existing functional groupings; ii) Isolation of new functional groupings; and iii) Soft clustering of multifunctional hub proteins to multiple functional groupings.",2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,protein protein interaction;scale free network;cluster analysis;biological classification;knowledge extraction;combinatorics;bioinformatics;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Next, multi-relational classification was applied to analyze the interplay between each group's anthropometric body measurements. Throughout this study, three- dimensional (3-D) body scans were used to verify the validity of our findings.

Integrating pattern mining in relational databases,Toon Calders (University of Antwerp);Bart Goethals (University of Antwerp);Adriana Prado (University of Antwerp);,"2064105222,1992071743,2140192241","Almost a decade ago, Imielinski and Mannila introduced the notion of Inductive Databases to manage KDD applications just as DBMSs successfully manage business applications. The goal is to follow one of the key DBMS paradigms: building optimizing compilers for ad hoc queries. During the past decade, several researchers proposed extensions to the popular relational query language, SQL, in order to express such mining queries. In this paper, we propose a completely different and new approach, which extends the DBMS itself, not the query language, and integrates the mining algorithms into the database query optimizer. To this end, we introduce virtual mining views, which can be queried as if they were traditional relational tables (or views). Every time the database system accesses one of these virtual mining views, a mining algorithm is triggered to materialize all tuples needed to answer the query. We show how this can be done effectively for the popular association rule and frequent set mining problems.",2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,sargable;view;query by example;optimizing compiler;query optimization;knowledge extraction;information extraction;data mining;database;algorithm;computer science;
Why does subsequence time-series clustering produce sine waves?,Tsuyoshi Idé (IBM);,2107715069,The data mining and machine learning communities were surprised when Keogh et al. (2003) pointed out that the k-means cluster centers in subsequence time-series clustering become sinusoidal pseudo-patterns for almost all kinds of input time-series data. Understanding this mechanism is an important open problem in data mining. Our new theoretical approach (based on spectral clustering and translational symmetry) explains why the cluster centers of k-means naturally tend to form sinusoidal patterns.,2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,k means clustering;time series;knowledge extraction;information extraction;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;
A data mining approach to the joint evaluation of field and manufacturing data in automotive industry,Christian Manuel Strobel (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology);Tomas Hrycej (Daimler AG);,"2140445832,1219492259","The manufacturing quality can be evaluated only by considering the failure behavior of the product in the field. When relating manufacturing events to failure events, the main challenge is to master the huge number of combinations of both event types, of which each is only covered by a small number of occurrences. Additionally, this leads to the problem of selection of interesting findings – the appropriateness of the selection criterion for consequent decision making is a critical point. Another challenge is the necessity of mapping the process of manufacturing tests to a vector of variables characterizing the manufacturing process. The solution presented, focuses on correct rule generation and selection in the case of combinations with low coverage. Therefore statistical and decision theory approaches were used. The multiple hypothesis aspect of the rule set has also been considered.

The future of citeseer: citeseer x,C. Lee Giles (Pennsylvania State University);,2124749556,"CiteSeer, a public online computer and information science search engine and digital library, was introduced in 1997 and was a radical departure from the traditional methods of academic and scientific document access and analysis. Computer and information scientists quickly became used to and expected immediate access to their literature and CiteSeer provided a popular partial solution. CiteSeer was based on these features: actively acquiring new documents, automatic citation indexing, and automatic linking of citations and documents. CiteSeer, now hosted at the Pennsylvania State University with several mirrors, has over 750,000 documents. The current CiteSeer model is to a limited extent portable and was recently extended to academic business documents (SMEALSearch). Why has CiteSeer been so popular and how should it progress? What is its role with regards to other similar systems such as the Google Scholar and DBLP? What role should CiteSeer play in the open access movement? We discuss this and the Next Generation CiteSeer project, CiteSeerx, which will emphasize CiteSeer as a research tool, research web service, and researcher facilitator and testbed. In contrast to the current tightly integrated CiteSeer architecture, CiteSeerx will be modular, scalable and self managed. We will discuss how new intelligent data mining and information extraction algorithms will provide improved and new indexes, enhanced document access, expanded and automatic document gathering, collaboratories, new data and metadata resources, active mirroring, and web services. As an example of new features, we point out our new API based acknowledgement index and search.

This reduction is done without loss of information, that is, the complete collection of frequent itemsets can still be derived from the collection of closed non-derivable itemsets.

Variations of these random walk models are shown to be effective at identifying latent Web communities and revealing link topology.

The proposed aggregate refinement operator allows a more efficient search through the hypothesis space and thus can be beneficial for many relational learners that use aggregates. As an example application, we have implemented the refinement operator in a relational decision tree induction system.

When efficient model averaging out-performs boosting and bagging,Ian Davidson (State University of New York System);Wei Fan (IBM);,"2560595684,2491264568","The Bayes optimal classifier (BOC) is an ensemble technique used extensively in the statistics literature. However, compared to other ensemble techniques such as bagging and boosting, BOC is less known and rarely used in data mining. This is partly due to BOC being perceived as being inefficient and because bagging and boosting consistently outperforms a single model, which raises the question: “Do we even need BOC in datamining?”. We show that the answer to this question is “yes” by illustrating several recent efficient model averaging approximations to BOC can significantly outperform bagging and boosting in realistic situations such as extensive class label noise, sample selection bias and many-class problems.

Our strategy for incorporating new data is based on bias management and gradual adaptation. Starting with the simple Naive Bayes, we scale up the complexity by gradually increasing the maximum number of allowable attribute dependencies, and then by searching for new dependences in the extended search space. Since updating the structure is a costly task, we use new data to primarily adapt the parameters and only if this is really necessary, do we adapt the structure. The method for handling concept drift is based on the Shewhart P-Chart. We evaluated our adaptive algorithms on artificial domains and benchmark problems and show its advantages and future applicability in real-world on-line learning systems.",2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,concept drift;bayesian network;bias;biological classification;knowledge extraction;semantics;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

Adaptive segmentation-based symbolic representations of time series for better modeling and lower bounding distance measures,Bernard Hugueney (Lamsade);,1975944840,"Time series data-mining algorithms usually scale poorly with regard to dimensionality. Symbolic representations have proven to be a very effective way to reduce the dimensionality of time series even using simple aggregations over episodes of the same length and a fixed set of symbols. However, computing adaptive symbolic representations would enable more accurate representations of the dataset without compromising the dimensionality reduction. Therefore we propose a new generic framework to compute adaptive Segmentation Based Symbolic Representations (SBSR) of time series. SBSR can be applied to any model but we focus on piecewise constant models (SBSRL0) which are the most commonly used. SBSR are built by computing both the episode boundaries and the symbolic alphabet in order to minimize information loss of the resulting symbolic representation.

This also means their learning process is more expensive. This paper addresses this situation by defining and using “Decoupled Conditional Random Fields (DCRFs)”, a variant of CRFs whose learning process is more efficient as it decouples the tasks of learning potentials.

Traditional algorithms, developed for binary (or Boolean) attributes, can be applied to such data with a prerequisite of transforming non-binary (continuous or categorical) attribute domains into binary ones.

In this paper we propose to overcome this limitation by introducing the concept of mining frequent attribute profiles that describes the relationships between the original attributes. By this concept, previously hidden interactions can be discovered and redundant patterns that are identified by traditional methods are eliminated.

In brief, we missed an approach that at the same time: defines support as the number of pattern instances, allows input data that consists of more than one sequence, implements time constraints on a pattern instance, and counts multiple instances of a pattern within one interval sequence. In this paper we propose a new support definition which incorporates these properties. We also describe an algorithm that employs the new support definition and demonstrate its performance on field data from the automotive business.",2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,temporal database;knowledge extraction;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

We develop several mappings from continuous NMR-spectra to discrete text-like data. The new mappings include redundancies into the discrete data, which proofs helpful for the PLSI-model used afterwards.

Learning a distance metric for object identification without human supervision,Satoshi Oyama (Kyoto University);Katsumi Tanaka (Kyoto University);,"2126393252,2100196114","A method is described for learning a distance metric for use in object identification that does not require human supervision. It is based on two assumptions. One is that pairs of different names refer to different objects. The other is that names are arbitrary. These two assumptions justify using pairs of data items for objects with different names as “cannot-be-linked” example pairs for learning a distance metric for use in clustering ambiguous names. The metric learning is formulated using only dissimilar example pairs as a convex quadratic programming problem that can be solved much faster than a semi-definite programming problem, which generally must be solved to learn a distance metric matrix.

Learning approximate MRFs from large transaction data,Chao Wang (Ohio State University);Srinivasan Parthasarathy (Ohio State University);,"2604785398,2106796124","In this paper we consider the problem of learning approximate Markov Random Fields (MRFs) from large transaction data. We rely on frequent itemsets to learn MRFs on the data. Since learning exact large MRFs is generally intractable, we resort to learning approximate MRFs. Our proposed modeling approach first employs graph partitioning to cluster variables into balanced disjoint partitions, and then augments important interactions across partitions to capture interdependencies across them. A novel treewidth based augmentation scheme is proposed to boost performance. We learn an exact local MRF for each partition and then combine all the local MRFs together to derive a global model of the data. A greedy approximate inference scheme is developed on this global model. We demonstrate the use of the learned MRFs on the selectivity estimation problem.

On temporal evolution in data streams,Charu C. Aggarwal (IBM);,2146335907,"In recent years, the progress in hardware technology has made it possible for organizations to store and record large streams of transactional data. This results in databases which grow without limit at a rapid rate. This data can often show important changes in trends over time. In such cases, it is useful to understand, visualize, and diagnose the evolution of these trends. In this talk, we discuss a method to diagnose the changes in the underlying data stream and other related methods for change detection in streams. We also discuss the problem of data stream evolution in the context of mining algorithms such as clustering and classification. In many cases, mining algorithms may not function as effectively because of the change in the underlying data.

Learning to have fun,Jonathan Schaeffer (University of Alberta);,2278512575,"Games have played a major role in the history of artificial intelligence research. The goal of this research largely has been to build programs capable of defeating strong human players. Most of the literature has been devoted to two-player, perfect information games—games where the research results have little wide-spread applicability. However, over the past few years the need for improved AI techniques have become apparent in commercial computer games, a $25 billion industry. Laird and van Lent call the new generation of commercial games “AI's killer application”. The buying public wants to see realistic artificial intelligence in these products. Here the the metric is a “fun” experience, not winning. Hence, the outcomes from research using these applications will be of much wider applicability.

Challenges of urban sensing,Henry Tirri;,2627706458,"Wireless sensor networks are emerging as a critical information technology, and they are continuing the trend originating in mainframe computing currently at the stage of mobile computing. This trend shows several aspects consistent in the evolution of computing including the increasing hardware miniaturization of the computing units and an increasing emphasis of the role of communication between the computing units – “networking”. In addition from the software side there is an increasing need to software solutions that are robust, exhibit distributed control, collaborative interfaces resulting in adaptive capabilities also at the system level. Like the present Internet, wireless sensor networks are large-scale distributed systems, but composed of smart sensors and actuators. They will eventually infuse the physical world and provide “grounding” for the Internet thus creating the Internet of Things. Research on wireless sensor networks has been taking place at several levels, from the lowest physical level to the highest information level – the latter is much less developed than the research at the physical levels. In addition, much of the research in wireless sensor networks has been focusing on military or science applications. However, wireless sensor networks can also play an important role in the realization of ubiquitous computing for everyday life – creating what we call “Urban sensing environment”. In urban sensing many natural gateways exist to collect and process the sensor information – static ones such as media devices, or mobile devices such as smart phones that can collect sensor information when entering the communication range of an active sensor. Some of the applications of wireless sensor network technology at home include, in addition to the surveillance functions, adding “intelligence” to utility consumption, electronic tagging, contamination control and disaster monitoring. Similarly at the community level “traffic monitoring” including people allows a development of totally unseen services from micro weather forecasts to new ways for “sensing the environment” for entertainment. In this talk we will outline some of the research challenges for urban sensing, and the role of learning and data analysis techniques for solving those challenges.",2006,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,key distribution in wireless sensor networks;visual sensor network;mobile wireless sensor network;sensor web;internet of things;mobile device;weather forecasting;wireless sensor network;data analysis;ubiquitous computing;information technology;embedded system;computer security;data mining;simulation;computer science;

VOGUE relies on a novel Variable-Gap Sequence miner (VGS), to mine frequent patterns with different lengths and gaps between elements. It then uses these mined sequences to build the state machine. Moreover, we propose two variations of VOGUE: C-VOGUE that tends to decrease even further the state space complexity of VOGUE by pruning frequent sequences that are artifacts of other primary frequent sequences; and K-VOGUE that allows for sequences to form the same frequent pattern even if they do not have an exact match of elements in all the positions. However, the different elements have to share similar characteristics. We apply VOGUE to the task of protein sequence classification on real data from the PROSITE and SCOP protein families.

Mining Sequential Patterns from Temporal Streaming Data,Alice Marascu (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation);Florent Masseglia (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation);,"1948455341,2440503352","In recent years, emerging applications introduced new constraints for data mining methods. These constraints are typical of a new kind of data: the data streams. In a data stream processing, memory usage is restricted, new elements are generated continuously and have to be considered as fast as possible, no blocking operator can be performed and the data can be examined only once. At this time and to the best of our knowledge, no method has been proposed for mining sequential patterns in data streams. We argue that the main reason is the combinatory phenomenon related to sequential pattern mining. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on sequences alignment for mining approximate sequential patterns in Web usage data streams.

Ensembles of randomly-generated nested dichotomies have proven to be an effective approach to multi-class learning problems [1]. However, sampling trees by giving each tree equal probability means that the depth of a tree is limited only by the number of classes, and very unbalanced trees can negatively affect runtime. In this paper we investigate two approaches to building balanced nested dichotomies—class-balanced nested dichotomies and data-balanced nested dichotomies—and evaluate them in the same ensemble setting. Using C4.5 decision trees as the base models, we show that both approaches can reduce runtime with little or no effect on accuracy, especially on problems with many classes.

We devise online algorithms that learn routes between important locations and predict the next location when the user is moving. We incrementally build clusters of cell sequences to represent physical routes. Predictions are based on destination probabilities derived from these clusters. Other context variables such as the current time can be integrated into the model.

However, in reality, there exist multiple, heterogeneous social networks, each representing a particular kind of relationship, and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task. In this paper, we systematically analyze the problem of mining hidden communities on heterogeneous social networks.

Interestingness is not a dichotomy: introducing softness in constrained pattern mining,Stefano Bistarelli (University of Pisa);Francesco Bonchi (Institute for Scientific Interchange);,"337921378,2176652147","The paradigm of pattern discovery based on constraints was introduced with the aim of providing to the user a tool to drive the discovery process towards potentially interesting patterns, with the positive side effect of achieving a more efficient computation. So far the research on this paradigm has mainly focussed on the latter aspect: the development of efficient algorithms for the evaluation of constraint-based mining queries. Due to the lack of research on methodological issues, the constraint-based pattern mining framework still suffers from many problems which limit its practical relevance. As a solution, in this paper we introduce the new paradigm of pattern discovery based on Soft Constraints. Albeit simple, the proposed paradigm overcomes all the major methodological drawbacks of the classical constraint-based paradigm, representing an important step further towards practical pattern discovery.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,dichotomy;knowledge extraction;data mining;artificial intelligence;algorithm;computer science;

Also, in several cases, different distance functions can provide diverse but equally intuitive results (according to the specific focus of each measure). In order to address the above issues, we elaborate on the construction of a hybrid index structure that supports query-by-example on shape and structural distance measures, therefore lending enhanced exploratory power to the system user. The shape distance measure that the index supports is the ubiquitous Euclidean distance, while the structural distance measure that we utilize is based on important periodic features extracted from a sequence. This new measure is phase-invariant and can provide flexible sequence characterizations, loosely resembling the Dynamic Time Warping, requiring only a fraction of the computational cost of the latter. Exploiting the relationship between the Euclidean and periodic measure, the new hybrid index allows for powerful query processing, enabling the efficient answering of kNN queries on both measures in a single index scan. We envision that our system can provide a basis for fast tracking of correlated time-delayed events, with applications in data visualization, financial market analysis, machine monitoring/diagnostics and gene expression data analysis.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,metric;knowledge extraction;data visualization;information extraction;data mining;artificial intelligence;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Numbers in multi-relational data mining,Arno J. Knobbe (Leiden University);Eric K. Y. Ho;,"1229146049,2656893840","Numeric data has traditionally received little attention in the field of Multi-Relational Data Mining (MRDM). It is often assumed that numeric data can simply be turned into symbolic data by means of discretisation. However, very few guidelines for successfully applying discretisation in MRDM exist. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the loss of information involved is negligible. In this paper, we consider different alternatives for dealing with numeric data in MRDM. Specifically, we analyse the adequacy of discretisation by performing a number of experiments with different existing discretisation approaches, and comparing the results with a procedure that handles numeric data dynamically. The discretisation procedures considered include an algorithm that is insensitive to the multi-relational structure of the data, and two algorithms that do involve this structure. With the empirical results thus obtained, we shed some light on the applicability of both dynamic and static procedures (discretisation), and give recommendations for when and how they can best be applied.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data field;relational database;data analysis;knowledge extraction;information extraction;data structure;world wide web;data mining;database;computer science;

Conversational recommender systems guide users through a product space, alternatively making product suggestions and eliciting user feedback. Critiquing is a common and powerful form of feedback, where a user can express her feature preferences by applying a series of directional critiques over recommendations, instead of providing specific value preferences. For example, a user might ask for a ‘less expensive’ vacation in a travel recommender; thus ‘less expensive’ is a critique over the price feature. The expectation is that on each cycle, the system discovers more about the user’s soft product preferences from minimal information input. In this paper we describe three different strategies for knowledge discovery from user preferences that improve recommendation efficiency in a conversational system using critiquing. Moreover, we will demonstrate that while the strategies work well separately, their combined effort has the potential to considerably increase recommendation efficiency even further.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,product topology;data analysis;recommender system;knowledge extraction;knowledge management;world wide web;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;computer science;

By dynamically building a decision tree for every item as data arrive, the incoming data stream is used effectively although an inevitable trade off between accuracy and amount of memory used is introduced. By adding a simple personalization step using a hierarchy of the items, it is possible to improve the predicted ratings made by each decision tree and generate recommendations in real-time. Empirical studies with the dynamically built decision trees show that the personalization step improves the overall predicted accuracy.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,collaborative filtering;empirical research;knowledge extraction;world wide web;operating system;computer security;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;

Mining paraphrases from self-anchored web sentence fragments,Marius Pasca (Google);,1892622091,"Near-synonyms or paraphrases are beneficial in a variety of natural language and information retrieval applications, but so far their acquisition has been confined to clean, trustworthy collections of docu- ments with explicit external attributes. When such attributes are avail- able, such as similar time stamps associated to a pair of news articles, previous approaches rely on them as signals of potentially high content overlap between the articles, often embodied in sentences that are only slight, paraphrase-based variations of each other. This paper introduces a new unsupervised method for extracting paraphrases from an informa- tion source of completely different nature and scale, namely unstructured text across arbitrary Web textual documents. In this case, no useful ex- ternal attributes are consistently available for all documents. Instead, the paper introduces linguistically-motivated text anchors, which are identi- fied automatically within the documents. The anchors are instrumental in the derivation of paraphrases through lightweight pairwise alignment of Web sentence fragments.

Statistical relational learning: an inductive logic programming perspective,Luc De Raedt (University of Freiburg);,189137728,"In the past few years there has been a lot of work lying at the intersection of probability theory, logic programming and machine learning [14,18,13,9,6,1,11]. This work is known under the names of statistical relational learning [7,5], probabilistic logic learning [4], or probabilistic inductive logic programming. Whereas most of the existing works have started from a probabilistic learning perspective and extended probabilistic formalisms with relational aspects, I shall take a di.erent perspective, in which I shall start from inductive logic programming and study how inductive logic programming formalisms, settings and techniques can be extended to deal with probabilistic issues. This tradition has already contributed a rich variety of valuable formalisms and techniques, including probabilistic Horn abduction by David Poole, PRISMs by Sato, stochastic logic programs by Muggleton [13] and Cussens [2], Bayesian logic programs [10,8] by Kersting and De Raedt, and Logical Hidden Markov Models [11]. The main contribution of this talk is the introduction of three probabilistic inductive logic programming settings which are derived from the learning from entailment, from interpretations and from proofs settings of the field of inductive logic programming [3]. Each of these settings contributes di.erent notions of probabilistic logic representations, examples and probability distributions. The first setting, probabilistic learning from entailment, is incorporated in the wellknown PRISM system [19] and Cussens's Failure Adjusted Maximisation approach to parameter estimation in stochastic logic programs [2]. A novel system that was recently developed and that fits this paradigm is the nFOIL system [12]. It combines key principles of the well-known inductive logic programming system FOIL [15] with the naive Bayes' appraoch. In probabilistic learning from entailment, examples are ground facts that should be probabilistically entailed by the target logic program. The second setting, probabilistic learning from interpretations, is incorporated in Bayesian logic programs [10,8], which integrate Bayesian networks with logic programs. This setting is also adopted by [6]. Examples in this setting are Herbrand interpretations that should be a probabilistic model for the target theory. The third setting, learning from proofs [17], is novel. It is motivated by the learning of stochastic context free grammars from tree banks. In this setting, examples are proof trees that should be probabilistically provable from the unknown stochastic logic programs. The sketched settings (and their instances presented) are by no means the only possible settings for probabilistic inductive logic programming, but still – I hope – provide useful insights into the state-of-the-art of this exciting field.

Non-stationary environment compensation using sequential EM algorithm for robust speech recognition,Haifeng Shen (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications);Jun Guo (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications);Gang Liu (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications);Qunxia Li (University of Science and Technology Beijing);,"2104512194,2101091369,2694495852,2170125751","The paper presents a non-stationary environment compensation using sequential EM estimation for tracking the complicated environment. All of the noisy features used in the recognition system are effectively compensated. The speech corruption in the log domain such as the 24 log-filterbank coefficients and the log-energy feature can be modeled as a nonlinear model. For efficient estimating noise parameter using the subsequent sequential Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the nonlinear environment model is linearized by the truncated first-order vector Taylor series (VTS) approximation. Due to the cepstral features are nearly independence, we train the clean speech using cepstral features and the log-energy feature, and then obtain a diagonal Gaussian mixture model in the log domain by taking inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT). The experiments are conducted on the large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system. Results demonstrate that it achieves attractive improvements when compared with CMN (cepstral mean normalization) and the batch-EM based compensation approach.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,expectation maximization algorithm;knowledge extraction;speech recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;
An imbalanced data rule learner,Canh Hao Nguyen (Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology);Tu Bao Ho (Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology);,"2060001077,2135463138","Imbalanced data learning has recently begun to receive much attention from research and industrial communities as traditional machine learners no longer give satisfactory results. Solutions to the problem generally attempt to adapt standard learners to the imbalanced data setting. Basically, higher weights are assigned to small class examples to avoid their being overshadowed by the large class ones. The difficulty determining a reasonable weight for each example remains. In this work, we propose a scheme to weight examples of the small class based solely on local data distributions.

Improved naive bayes for extremely skewed misclassification costs,Aleksander Kołcz (AOL);Abdur Chowdhury (AOL);,"2515703489,2707360860","Naive Bayes has been an effective and important classifier in the text categorization domain despite violations of its underlying assumptions. Although quite accurate, it tends to provide poor estimates of the posterior class probabilities, which hampers its application in the cost-sensitive context. The apparent high confidence with which certain errors are made is particularly problematic when misclassification costs are highly skewed, since conservative setting of the decision threshold may greatly decrease the classifier utility. We propose an extension of the Naive Bayes algorithm aiming to discount the confidence with which errors are made. The approach is based on measuring the amount of change to feature distribution necessary to reverse the initial classifier decision and can be implemented efficiently without over-complicating the process of Naive Bayes induction. In experiments with three benchmark document collections, the decision-reversal Naive Bayes is demonstrated to substantially improve over the popular multinomial version of the Naive Bayes algorithm, in some cases performing more than 40% better.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,bayes error rate;bayes classifier;confidence;naive bayes classifier;posterior probability;quantitative analysis;biological classification;data analysis;knowledge extraction;content analysis;data mining;pattern recognition;statistics;computer science;

Rank measures for ordering,Jin Huang (University of Western Ontario);Charles X. Ling (University of Western Ontario);,"2441611617,1980182462","Many data mining applications require a ranking, rather than a mere classification, of cases. Examples of these applications are widespread, including Internet search engines (ranking of pages returned) and customer relationship management (ranking of profitable customers). However, little theoretical foundation and practical guideline have been established to assess the merits of different rank measures for ordering. In this paper, we first review several general criteria to judge the merits of different single-number measures. Then we propose a novel rank measure, and compare the commonly used rank measures and our new one according to the criteria. This leads to a preference order for these rank measures. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets to confirm the preference order. The results of the paper will be very useful in evaluating and comparing rank algorithms.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,rank reversals in decision making;ranking svm;order theory;profitability index;search engine;the internet;data analysis;knowledge extraction;information extraction;data science;data mining;artificial intelligence;computer science;

Data analysis in the life sciences — sparking ideas —,Michael R. Berthold (University of Konstanz);,2117114528,"Data from various areas of Life Sciences have increasingly caught the attention of data mining and machine learning researchers. Not only is the amount of data available mind-boggling but the diverse and heterogenous nature of the information is far beyond any other data analysis problem so far. In sharp contrast to classical data analysis scenarios, the life science area poses challenges of a rather different nature for mainly two reasons. Firstly, the available data stems from heterogenous information sources of varying degrees of reliability and quality and is, without the interactive, constant interpretation of a domain expert, not useful. Furthermore, predictive models are of only marginal interest to those users – instead they hope for new insights into a complex, biological system that is only partially represented within that data anyway. In this scenario, the data serves mainly to create new insights and generate new ideas that can be tested. Secondly, the notion of feature space and the accompanying measures of similarity cannot be taken for granted. Similarity measures become context dependent and it is often the case that within one analysis task several different ways of describing the objects of interest or measuring similarity between them matter. Some more recently published work in the data analysis area has started to address some of these issues. For example, data analysis in parallel universes [1], that is, the detection of patterns of interest in various di.erent descriptor spaces at the same time, and mining of frequent, discriminative fragments in large, molecular data bases [2]. In both cases, sheer numerical performance is not the focus; it is rather the discovery of interpretable pieces of evidence that lights up new ideas in the users mind. Future work in data analysis in the life sciences needs to keep this in mind: the goal is to trigger new ideas and stimulate interesting associations.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,context dependent memory;feature vector;predictive modelling;data analysis;data science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Ravi (University at Albany, SUNY);","2560595684,2150130480","We explore the use of instance and cluster-level constraints with ag- glomerative hierarchical clustering. Though previous work has illustrated the benefits of using constraints for non-hierarchical clustering, their application to hierarchical clustering is not straight-forward for two primary reasons. First, some constraint combinations make the feasibility problem (Does there exist a single feasible solution?) NP-complete. Second, some constraint combinations when used with traditional agglomerative algorithms can cause the dendrogram to stop prematurely in a dead-end solution even though there exist other feasible solu- tions with a significantly smaller number of clusters. When constraints lead to efficiently solvable feasibility problems and standard agglomerative algorithms do not give rise to dead-end solutions, we empirically illustrate the benefits of using constraints to improve cluster purity and average distortion. Furthermore, we introduce the new γ constraint and use it in conjunction with the triangle inequality to considerably improve the efficiency of agglomerative clustering.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,hierarchical clustering of networks;brown clustering;constrained clustering;triangle inequality;constraint;hierarchical clustering;cluster analysis;data analysis;mathematical chemistry;knowledge extraction;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

A Random Method for Quantifying Changing Distributions in Data Streams,Haixun Wang (IBM);Jian Pei (Simon Fraser University);,"2116756368,2126330539","In applications such as fraud and intrusion detection, it is of great interest to measure the evolving trends in the data. We consider the problem of quantifying changes between two datasets with class labels. Traditionally, changes are often measured by first estimating the probability distributions of the given data, and then computing the distance, for instance, the K-L divergence, between the estimated distributions. However, this approach is computationally infeasible for large, high dimensional datasets. The problem becomes more challenging in the streaming data environment, as the high speed makes it difficult for the learning process to keep up with the concept drifts in the data. To tackle this problem, we propose a method to quantify concept drifts using a universal model that incurs minimal learning cost. In addition, our model also provides the ability of performing classification.",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,intrusion detection system;knowledge extraction;computer security;data mining;artificial intelligence;algorithm;computer science;

Unsupervised Discretization Using Tree-Based Density Estimation,Gabi Schmidberger (University of Waikato);Eibe Frank (University of Waikato);,"2042635080,2165714491","This paper presents an unsupervised discretization method that performs density estimation for univariate data. The subintervals that the discretization produces can be used as the bins of a histogram. Histograms are a very simple and broadly understood means for display- ing data, and our method automatically adapts bin widths to the data. It uses the log-likelihood as the scoring function to select cut points and the cross-validated log-likelihood to select the number of intervals. We compare this method with equal-width discretization where we also se- lect the number of bins using the cross-validated log-likelihood and with equal-frequency discretization. Discretization is applied whenever continuous data needs to be transformed into discrete data. We consider data that is organized into instances with a fixed number of attributes. Some or all of the attributes might be continuous. To discretize a continuous attribute the range of its values is divided into intervals. The attribute values are substituted by an identifier for each bin. Note that the new attribute is actually not categorical but ordered (1). In this paper we consider the problem of unsupervised discretization, where the discretization is based on the distribution of attribute values alone and there are no class labels. Moreover, we consider univariate discretization: our method only considers the attribute to be discretized, not the values of other attributes. Our algorithm treats unsupervised discretization as piece-wise constant den- sity estimation. The intervals gained from the discretization can be used to draw a histogram or used to pre-process the data for another data mining scheme. In the former case, the height of each bin h is the density that is computed from the bin width wi, the number of instances ni that fall into that bin, and the total number of instances N in the dataset:",2005,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,discretization of continuous features;discretization error;discretization;knowledge extraction;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Negative association rules also consider the same items, but in addition consider negated items (i.e. absent from transactions). Negative association rules are useful in market-basket analysis to identify products that conflict with each other or products that complement each other. They are also very convenient for associative classifiers, classifiers that build their classification model based on association rules. Many other applications would benefit from negative association rules if it was not for the expensive process to discover them. Indeed, mining for such rules necessitates the examination of an exponentially large search space. Despite their usefulness, and while they were referred to in many publications, very few algorithms to mine them have been proposed to date.

Traditional applications require that all data has to be located at the site where it is scrutinized. Nowadays, large amounts of heterogeneous, complex data reside on different, independently working computers which are connected to each other via local or wide area networks. In this paper, we propose a scalable density-based distributed clustering algorithm which allows a user-defined trade-off between clustering quality and the number of transmitted objects from the different local sites to a global server site. Our approach consists of the following steps: First, we order all objects located at a local site according to a quality criterion reflecting their suitability to serve as local representatives. Then we send the best of these representatives to a server site where they are clustered with a slightly enhanced density-based clustering algorithm. This approach is very efficient, because the local detemination of suitable representatives can be carried out quickly and independently from each other. Furthermore, based on the scalable number of the most suitable local representatives, the global clustering can be done very effectively and efficiently.

Constraint-based mining of episode rules and optimal window sizes,Nicolas Méger (Intelligence and National Security Alliance);Christophe Rigotti (Intelligence and National Security Alliance);,"2559010904,2124275409","Episode rules are patterns that can be extracted from a large event sequence, to suggest to experts possible dependencies among occurrences of event types. The corresponding mining approaches have been designed to find rules under a temporal constraint that specifies the maximum elapsed time between the first and the last event of the occurrences of the patterns (i.e., a window size constraint). In some applications the appropriate window size is not known, and furthermore, this size is not the same for different rules. To cope with this class of applications, it has been recently proposed in [2] to specifying the maximal elapsed time between two events (i.e., a maximum gap constraint) instead of a window size constraint. Unfortunately, we show that the algorithm proposed to handle the maximum gap constraint is not complete. In this paper we present a sound and complete algorithm to mine episode rules under the maximum gap constraint, and propose to find, for each rule, the window size corresponding to a local maximum of confidence. We show that the extraction can be efficiently performed in practice on real and synthetic datasets. Finally the experiments show that the notion of local maximum of confidence is significant in practice, since no local maximum are found in random datasets, while they can be found in real ones.",2004,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,confidence;data analysis;knowledge extraction;knowledge base;expert system;data mining;artificial intelligence;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Mining thick skylines over large databases,Wen Jin (Simon Fraser University);Jiawei Han (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign);Martin Ester (Simon Fraser University);,"2152882053,2121939561,2067196623","People recently are interested in a new operator, called skyline [3], which returns the objects that are not dominated by any other objects with regard to certain measures in a multi-dimensional space. Recent work on the skyline operator [3,15,8,13,2] focuses on efficient computation of skylines in large databases. However, such work gives users only thin skylines, i.e., single objects, which may not be desirable in some real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, called thick skyline, which recommends not only skyline objects but also their nearby neighbors within -distance. Efficient computation methods are developed including (1) two efficient algorithms, Sampling-and-Pruning and Indexing-and-Estimating, to find such thick skyline with the help of statistics or indexes in large databases, and (2) a highly efficient Microcluster-based algorithm for mining thick skyline. The Microcluster-based method not only leads to substantial savings in computation but also provides a cocise representation of the thick skyline in the case of high cardinalities. Our experimental performance study shows that the proposed methods are both efficient and effective.",2004,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,cardinal number;conjugate gradient method;search engine indexing;data analysis;sampling;knowledge extraction;data mining;database;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Properties and benefits of calibrated classifiers,Ira Cohen (Hewlett-Packard);Moises Goldszmidt (Hewlett-Packard);,"2128315080,2665434503","A calibrated classifier provides reliable estimates of the true probability that each test sample is a member of the class of interest.

In this paper we extend the theoretical foundation of these empirical observations. We prove that (1) a well calibrated classifier provides bounds on the Bayes error (2) calibrating a classifier is guaranteed not to decrease classification accuracy, and (3) the procedure of calibration provides the threshold or thresholds on the decision rule that minimize the classification error.

A tolerance rough set approach to clustering web search results,Chi Lang Ngo (University of Warsaw);Hung Son Nguyen (University of Warsaw);,"2675932166,2106019075","Two most popular approaches to facilitate searching for information on the web are represented by web search engine and web directories. Although the performance of search engines is improving every day, searching on the web can be a tedious and time-consuming task due to the huge size and highly dynamic nature of the web. Moreover, the user's ""intention behind the search"" is not clearly expressed which results in too general, short queries. Results returned by search engine can count from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of documents. One approach to manage the large number of results is clustering. Search results clustering can be defined as a process of automatical grouping search results into to thematic groups. However, in contrast to traditional document clustering, clustering of search results are done on-the-fly (per user query request) and locally on a limited set of results return from the search engine. Clustering of search results can help user navigate through large set of documents more efficiently. By providing concise, accurate description of clusters, it lets user localizes interesting document faster.In this paper, we proposed an approach to search results clustering based on Tolerance Rough Set following the work on document clustering [4,3].

When production rate matches consumption rate, and communication overhead between producer and consumer filters is minimized, a high degree of asynchrony is achieved. Following this strategy, our algorithm employs an asynchronous candidate generation, and minimizes communication between filters by transferring only the necessary aggregated information.

These fingerprints are stored in the prints database after time-consuming annotation by domain experts who must first of all determine the fingerprint type, i.e., whether a fingerprint depicts a protein family, superfamily or domain. To alleviate the annotation bottleneck, a system called PRECIS has been developed which automatically generates prints records, provisionally stored in a supplement called preprints. One limitation of PRECIS is that its classification heuristics, handcoded by proteomics experts, often misclassify fingerprint type; their error rate has been estimated at 40%. This paper reports on an attempt to build more accurate classifiers based on information drawn from the fingerprints themselves and from the SWISS-PROT database. Extensive experimentation using 10-fold cross-validation led to the selection of a model combiing the ReliefF feature selector with an SVM-RBF learner.

Although this optimization problem is generally intractable, we develop techniques that effectively prune the search space and efficiently compute optimal solutions in practice.

The watch activity introduces an unusual difficulty compared with conventional areas of application for text mining techniques since, instead of searching for frequent knowledge hidden in the texts, the target is unexpected knowledge. As a result, the usual measures used for knowledge discovery have to be revised. For that purpose, we have developed the UnexpectedMiner system using new measures for to estimate the unexpectedness of a document. Our system is evaluated using a base that contains articles relating to the field of machine learning.",2004,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data analysis;knowledge extraction;information technology;data processing;data science;data mining;artificial intelligence;computer science;

Balios: the engine for Bayesian logic programs,Kristian Kersting (University of Freiburg);Uwe Dick (University of Freiburg);,"2252032993,1478059075","Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) [4] combines techniques from machine learning with the representation of logic programming. It aims at inducing logical clauses, i.e, general rules from specific observations and background knowledge. Because of focusing on logical clauses, traditional ILP systems do not model uncertainty explicitly. On the other hand, state-of-the-art probabilistic models such as Bayesian networks (BN) [5], hidden Markov models, and stochastic context-free grammars have a rigid structure and therefore have problems representing a variable number of objects and relations among these objects. Recently, various relational extensions of traditional probabilistic models have been proposed, see [1] for an overview.

Real-world learning with Markov logic networks,Pedro M. Domingos (University of Washington);,2169012919,"Machine learning and data mining systems have achieved many impressive successes, but to become truly widespread they must be able to work with less help from people. This requires automating the data cleaning and integration process, handling multiple types of objects and relations at once, and easily incorporating domain knowledge. In this talk, I describe how we are pursuing these aims using Markov logic networks, a representation that combines first-order logic and probabilistic graphical models. Data from multiple sources is integrated by automatically learning mappings between the objects and terms in them. Rich relational structure is learned using a combination of ILP and statistical techniques. Knowledge is incorporated by viewing logic statements as soft constraints on the models to be learned. Application to a real-world university domain shows our approach to be accurate, efficient, and less labor-intensive than traditional ones.",2004,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,statistical relational learning;theoretical computer science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;
Strength in diversity: the advance of data analysis,David J. Hand (Imperial College London);,2175518357,"The scientific analysis of data is only around a century old. For most of that century, data analysis was the realm of only one discipline - statistics. As a consequence of the development of the computer, things have changed dramatically and now there are several such disciplines, including machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining. This paper looks at some of the similarities and some of the differences between these disciplines, noting where they intersect and, perhaps of more interest, where they do not. Particular issues examined include the nature of the data with which they are concerned, the role of mathematics, differences in the objectives, how the different areas of application have led to different aims, and how the different disciplines have led sometimes to the same analytic tools being developed, but also sometimes to different tools being developed.

Mining history of changes to web access patterns,Qiankun Zhao (Nanyang Technological University);Sourav S. Bhowmick (Nanyang Technological University);,"2256818293,2168903744","Recently, a lot of work has been done in web usage mining [2]. Among them, mining of frequent Web Access Pattern (WAP) is the most well researched issue [1]. The idea is to transform web logs into sequences of events with user identifications and timestamps, and then extract association and sequential patterns from the events data with certain metrics. The frequent WAPs have been applied to a wide range of applications such as personalization, system improvement, site modification, business intelligence, and usage characterization [2]. However, most of the existing techniques focus only on mining frequent WAP from snapshot web usage data, while web usage data is dynamic in real life. While the frequent WAPs are useful in many applications, knowledge hidden behind the historical changes of web usage data, which reflects how WAPs change, is also critical to many applications such as adaptive web, web site maintenance, business intelligence, etc.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to discover hidden knowledge from historical changes to WAPs. Rather than focusing on the occurrence of the WAPs, we focus on the frequently changing web access patterns. We define a novel type of knowledge, Frequent Mutating WAP (FM-WAP), based on the historical changes of WAPs. The FM-WAP mining process consists of three phases. Firstly, web usage data is represented as a set of WAP trees and partitioned into a sequence of WAP groups ( subsets of the WAP trees) according to a user-defined calendar pattern, where each WAP group is represented as a WAP forest. Consequently, the log data is represented by a sequence of WAP forests called WAP history. Then, changes among the WAP history are detected and stored in the global forest. Finally, the FM-WAP is extracted by a traversal of the global forest. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach can produce novel knowledge of web access patterns efficiently with good scalability.",2004,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,web accessibility;web mining;world wide web;data mining;database;computer science;

The research work presented in this paper is aimed at discovering general synthesis methods from chemical reaction databases in order to design generic and reusable synthesis plans. The knowledge discovery process relies on frequent levelwise itemset search and association rule extraction, but also on chemical knowledge involved within every step of the knowledge discovery process.

Incremental nonlinear PCA for classification,Byung Joo Kim (Youngsan University);Il Kon Kim (Kyungpook National University);,"2288297137,2167699960","The purpose of this study is to propose a new online and nonlinear PCA(OL-NPCA) method for feature extraction from the incremental data. Kernel PCA(KPCA) is widely used for nonlinear feature extraction, however, it has been pointed out that KPCA has the following problems. First, applying KPCA to patterns requires storing and finding the eigenvectors of a kernel matrix, which is infeasible for a large number of data N. Second problem is that in order to update the eigenvectors with an another data, the whole eigenspace should be recomputed. OL-NPCA overcomes these problems by incremental eigenspace update method with a feature mapping function. According to the experimental results, which comes from applying OL-NPCA to a toy and a large data problem, OL-NPCA shows following advantages. First, OL-NPCA is more efficient in memory requirement than KPCA. Second advantage is that OL-NPCA is comparable in performance to KPCA. Furthermore, performance of OL-NPCA can be easily improved by re-learning the data. For classification extracted features are used as input for least squares support vector machine. In our experiments we show that proposed feature extraction method is comparable in performance to a Kernel PCA and proposed classification system shows a high classification performance on UCI benchmarking data and NIST handwritten data set.",2004,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,kernel principal component analysis;principal component analysis;feature extraction;biological classification;least squares;data analysis;competitive intelligence;knowledge extraction;speech recognition;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

Reducing data stream sliding windows by cyclic tree-like histograms,Francesco Buccafurri (NuStar Energy);Gianluca Lax;,"276193487,2136486940","Data reduction is a basic step in a KDD process useful for delivering to successive stages more concise and meaningful data. When mining is applied to data streams, that are continuous data flows, the issue of suitably reducing them is highly interesting, in order to arrange effective approaches requiring multiple scans on data, that, in such a way, may be performed over one or more reduced sliding windows. A class of queries, whose importance in the context of KDD is widely accepted, corresponds to sum range queries. In this paper we propose a histogram-based technique for reducing sliding windows supporting approximate arbitrary (i.e., non biased) sum range queries. The histogram, based on a hierarchical structure (opposed to the flat structure of traditional ones), results suitable for directly supporting hierarchical queries, and, thus, drill-down and roll-up operations. In addition, the structure well supports sliding window shifting and quick query answering (both these operations are loarithmic in the sliding window size).

A central notion in the development of the bounds are the l-free sets, that form the basis of many well-known representations. We will bound the maximal cardinality of an l-free set based on the size of the database. More concrete, we compute a lower bound for the size of the database in terms of the size of the l-free set, and when the database size is smaller than this lower bound, we know that the set cannot be l-free.

SMOTEBoost: Improving Prediction of the Minority Class in Boosting,Nitesh V. Chawla (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce);Aleksandar Lazarevic (University of Minnesota);Lawrence O. Hall (University of South Florida);Kevin W. Bowyer (University of Notre Dame);,"1979796846,224350576,2159848645,2042301190","Many real world data mining applications involve learning from imbalanced data sets, where the particular events of interest may be very few when compared to the other classes. Learning from data sets that contain rare events usually produces biased classifiers that have a higher predictive accuracy over the majority class(es), but poorer predictive accuracy over the minority class of interest. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is a recent approach that is specifically designed for learning with minority classes. Boosting is a promising ensemble-based learning algorithm that can improve the classification performance of any weak classifier. This paper presents a novel approach for learning from rare classes, based on a combination of the SMOTE algorithm and the boosting procedure. Unlike standard boosting where all misclassified examples are given equal weights, the novel SMOTEBoost approach creates synthetic examples from the minority class, thus indirectly changing the updating weights and compensating for skewed distributions. The SMOTEBoost algorithm applied to several highly and moderately imbalanced data sets shows improvement in prediction performance on the rare class compared to standard boosting and to the SMOTE algorithm used with a single classifier. 1.

Preference Mining: A Novel Approach on Mining User Preferences for Personalized Applications,Stefan Holland (University of Augsburg);Martin Ester (Simon Fraser University);Werner Kießling (University of Augsburg);,"2146892979,2067196623,2218688930","Advanced personalized e-applications require comprehensive knowledge about their user's likes and dislikes in order to provide individual product recommendations, personal customer advice and custom-tailored product offers. In our approach we model such preferences as strict partial orders with A is better than B semantics, which has been proven to be very suitable in various e-applications. In this paper we present novel Preference Mining techniques for detecting strict partial order preferences in user log data. The main advantage of our approach is the semantic expressiveness of the Preference Mining results. Experimental evaluations prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms. Since the Preference Mining implementation uses sophisticated SQL statements to execute all data-intensive operations on database layer, our algorithms scale well even for large log data sets.

But while pushing anti-monotone constraints in a level-wise computation of frequent itemsets has been recognized to be always profitable, the case is different for monotone constraints. In fact, monotone constraints have been considered harder to push in the computation and less effective in pruning the search space. In this paper, we show that this prejudice is ill founded and introduce ExAnte, a pre-processing data reduction algorithm which reduces dramatically both the search space and the input dataset in constrained frequent pattern mining. Experimental results show a reduction of orders of magnitude, thus enabling a much easier mining task.

We present in this paper, a more intuitive definition that allows, in turn, interesting episodes to grow during the mining without any user-specified help. A convenient algorithm to efficiently discover the proposed unbounded episodes is also implemented.

Nevertheless, the data sets often contain clusters hidden in various subspaces of the original feature space. We present a pre-processing step for traditional clustering algorithms, which detects all interesting sub- spaces of high-dimensional data containing clusters. For this purpose, we dene a quality criterion for the interestingness of a subspace and pro- pose an ecient algorithm called RIS ( Ranking I nteresting S ubspaces) to examine all such subspaces.

Efficiently Finding Arbitrarily Scaled Patterns in Massive Time Series Databases,"Eamonn J. Keogh (University of California, Riverside);",2170070822,"The problem of efficiently finding patterns in massive time series databases has attracted great interest, and, at least for the Euclidean distance measure, may now be regarded as a solved problem. However in recent years there has been an increasing awareness that Euclidean distance is inappropriate for many real world applications. The limitations of Euclidean distance stems from the fact that it is very sensitive to distortions in the time axis. A partial solution to this problem, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), aligns the time axis before calculating the Euclidean distance. However, DTW can only address the problem of local scaling. As we demonstrate in this work, uniform scaling may be just as important in many domains, including applications as diverse as bioinformatics, space telemetry monitoring and motion editing for computer animation. In this work, we demonstrate a novel technique to speed up similarity search under uniform scaling. As we will demonstrate, our technique is simple and intuitive, and can achieve a speedup of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude under realistic settings.",2003,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,distortion;artificial intelligence;simulation;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

The answer depends on characteristics of the dataset and the selectivity of constraints. In this paper, we deeply characterize this trade-off and its related computational problem. As a result of this characterization, we introduce an adaptive strategy, named ACP (Adaptive Constraint Pushing) which exploits any conjunction of monotone and anti-monotone constraints to prune the search space, and level by level adapts the pruning to the input dataset and constraints, in order to maximize efficiency.",2003,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,searching the conformational space for docking;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

These approaches have run time complexity of O(nlogn) when using spatial index techniques, R + tree and grid cell. However, these methods are known to lack scalability with respect to dimensionality. In this paper, a unique approach to efficient neighborhood search and a new efficient density based clustering algorithm using EIN-rings are developed. Our approach exploits compressed vertical data structures, Peano Trees (P-trees'), and fast P-tree logical operations to accelerate the calculation of the density function within EIN-rings. This approach stands in contrast to the ubiquitous approach of vertically scanning horizontal data structures (records). The average run time complexity of our algorithm for spatial data in d-dimension is O(dnn). Our proposed method has comparable cardinality scalability with other density methods for small and medium size of data, but superior speed and dimensional scalability.",2003,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,dbscan;data stream clustering;cure data clustering algorithm;r tree;telemetry;spatial database;environmental impact assessment;curse of dimensionality;scalability;spatial analysis;time complexity;cluster analysis;data compression;planning;probability density function;biological classification;data analysis;geographic information system;information extraction;data structure;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;
On decision boundaries of Naive Bayes in continuous domains,Tapio Elomaa (University of Helsinki);Juho Rousu (University of Helsinki);,"2303288923,2228020513","Naive Bayesian classifiers assume the conditional independence of attribute values given the class. Despite this in practice often violated assumption, these simple classifiers have been found efficient, effective, and robust to noise. Discretization of continuous attributes in naive Bayesian classifiers has achieved a lot of attention recently. Continuous attributes need not necessarily be discretized, but it unifies their handling with nominal attributes and can lead to improved classifier performance. We show that optimal partitioning results from decision tree learning carry over to Naive Bayes as well. In particular, it sets decision boundaries on borders of segments with equal class frequency distribution. An optimal univariate discretization with respect to the Naive Bayes rule can be found in linear time but, unfortunately, optimal multivariate optimization is intractable.",2003,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,bayesian programming;naive bayes classifier;decision tree;time complexity;biological classification;knowledge extraction;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;
Exploring fringe settings of SVMs for classification,Adam Kowalczyk (Telstra);Bhavani Raskutti (Telstra);,"2630730722,337145742","There are many practical applications where learning from single class examples is either, the only possible solution, or has a distinct performance advantage. The first case occurs when obtaining examples of a second class is difficult, e.g., classifying sites of interest based on web accesses. The second situation is exemplified by the one-class support vector machine which was the winning submission of the second task of the KDD Cup 2002. This paper explores the limits of supervised learning using both positive and negative examples. To this end, we analyse the KDD Cup dataset using four classifiers (support vector machines and ridge regression) and several feature selection methods. Our analysis shows that there is a consistent pattern of performance differences between one and two-class learning for all algorithms investigated, and these patterns persist even with aggressive dimensionality reduction through automated feature selection.

Statistical σ-Partition Clustering over Data Streams,Nam Hun Park (Yonsei University);Won Suk Lee (Yonsei University);,"2307347862,2169618082","This paper proposes a grid-based clustering method that dynamically partitions the range of a grid-cell based on its distribution statistics of data elements in a data stream. Initially the multi-dimensional space of a data domain is partitioned into a set of mutually exclusive equal-size initial cells. As a new data element is generated continuously, each cell monitors the distribution statistics of data elements within its range. When the support of data elements in a cell becomes high enough, the cell is dynamically divided into two mutually exclusive smaller cells called intermediate cells by assuming the distribution of data elements is a normal distribution. Eventually, the dense sub-range of an initial cell is recursively partitioned until it becomes the smallest cell called a unit cell. In order to minimize the number of cells, a sparse intermediate or unit cell can be pruned if its support becomes much less than a minimum support. The performance of the proposed method is comparatively analyzed through a series of experiments.",2003,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,normal distribution;calculus;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
Mining Rules of Multi-level Diagnostic Procedure from Databases,Shusaku Tsumoto (Sofia Medical University);,122205434,"One of the most important features of expert reasoning is that each reasoning rule may be composed of several diagnostic steps, usually hierarchical differential diagnosis. For example, medical diagnosis include hierarchical diagnostic steps In this paper, the characteristics of experts' rules are closely examined from the viewpoint of hiearchical decision steps and a new approach to extract plausible rules is introduced, which consists of the following three procedures. First, the characterization of decision attributes (given classes) is extracted from databases and the concept hierarchy for given classes is calculated. Second, based on the hierarchy, rules for each hierarchical level are induced from data. Then, for each given class, rules for all the hierarchical levels are integrated into one rule. The proposed method was evaluated on medical databases, the experimental results of which show that induced rules correctly represent experts' decision processes.",2003,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,medical diagnosis;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;
Symbolic Distance Measurements Based on Characteristic Subspaces,Marcus-Christopher Ludl (Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence);,1582747444,"We introduce the subspace difference metric, a novel heterogeneous distance metric for calculating distances between points with both continuous and (unordered) categorical attributes. Our approach is based on the computation and comparison of characteristic subspaces (i.e. contexts) for each of the symbols and can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known value difference metric. Subsequently, as one possible extension, we propose a linearization of the computed symbolic distances by multidimensional scaling, thereby mapping a set of symbols onto the interval [0, 1]. Thus, even algorithms, which have originally been designed for usage with continuous attributes (e.g. clustering algorithms like k-means), may be applied to datasets containing discrete attributes, without having to adapt the algorithm itself. Finally, we evaluate the proposed metric and the linearization in quantitative and qualitative settings and exemplify the applicability in clustering domains.",2003,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,intrinsic metric;product metric;linearization;k means clustering;multidimensional scaling;metric;cluster analysis;vector space;biological classification;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;topology;machine learning;computer science;mathematics;

Analyzing Attribute Dependencies,Aleks Jakulin (University of Ljubljana);Ivan Bratko (University of Ljubljana);,"120349348,689465770","Many effective and efficient learning algorithms assume independence of attributes. They often perform well even in domains where this assumption is not really true. However, they may fail badly when the degree of attribute dependencies becomes critical. In this paper, we examine methods for detecting deviations from independence. These dependencies give rise to “interactions” between attributes which affect the performance of learning algorithms. We first formally define the degree of interaction between attributes through the deviation of the best possible “voting” classifier from the true relation between the class and the attributes in a domain. Then we propose a practical heuristic for detecting attribute interactions, called interaction gain. We experimentally investigate the suitability of interaction gain for handling attribute interactions in machine learning. We also propose visualization methods for graphical exploration of interactions in a domain.",2003,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,variable and attribute;attribute domain;biological classification;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;

However, if the minimal support threshold is set too low, or the data is highly correlated, the number of frequent itemsets itself can be prohibitively large. To overcome this problem, recently several proposals have been made to construct a concise representation of the frequent itemsets, instead of mining all frequent itemsets. The main goal of this paper is to identify redundancies in the set of all frequent itemsets and to exploit these redundancies in order to reduce the result of a mining operation. We present deduction rules to derive tight bounds on the support of candidate itemsets. We show how the deduction rules allow for constructing a minimal representation for all frequent itemsets. We also present connections between our proposal and recent proposals for concise representations and we give the results of experiments on real-life datasets that show the effectiveness of the deduction rules. In fact, the experiments even show that in many cases, first mining the concise representation, and then creating the frequent itemsets from this representation outperforms existing frequent set mining algorithms.",2002,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data analysis;data science;data mining;database;computer science;mathematics;

During each scan the number of points candidate to belong to the solution set is sensibly reduced. The second phase returns the exact solution by doing a single scan which examines further a little fraction of the data set.

The comparison immediately leads to a decomposition of the covariance matrix into two matrices: one capturing the ""noise"" and the other capturing useful ""information."" The paper also presents experimental results using Nasdaq 100 stock data.",2002,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,random matrix;covariance matrix;information extraction;econometrics;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Finally it is possible, without loss, to train SVMs on syllables generated from written material and use them to classify audio documents.

Association Rules for Expressing Gradual Dependencies,Eyke Hüllermeier (University of Marburg);,323026139,"Data mining methods originally designed for binary attributes can generally be extended to quantitative attributes by partitioning the related numeric domains. This procedure, however, comes along with a loss of information and, hence, has several disadvantages. This paper shows that fuzzy partitions can overcome some of these disadvantages. Particularly, fuzzy partitions allow for the representation of association rules expressing a tendency, that is, a gradual dependence between attributes. This type of rule is introduced and investigated from a conceptual as well as a computational point of view. The evaluation and representation of a gradual association is based on linear regression analysis. Furthermore, a complementary type of association, expressing Absolute deviations rather than tendencies, is discussed in this context.",2002,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,partition;association rule learning;fuzzy logic;linear regression;regression analysis;data analysis;information extraction;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
The Need for Low Bias Algorithms in Classification Learning from Large Data Sets,Damien Brain (Deakin University);Geoffrey I. Webb (Deakin University);,"2101943502,2126304162","This paper reviews the appropriateness for application to large data sets of standard machine learning algorithms, which were mainly developed in the context of small data sets. Sampling and parallelisation have proved useful means for reducing computation time when learning from large data sets. However, such methods assume that algorithms that were designed for use with what are now considered small data sets are also fundamentally suitable for large data sets. It is plausible that optimal learning from large data sets requires a different type of algorithm to optimal learning from small data sets. This paper investigates one respect in which data set size may affect the requirements of a learning algorithm - the bias plus variance decomposition of classification error. Experiments show that learning from large data sets may be more effective when using an algorithm that places greater emphasis on bias management, rather than variance management.",2002,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,stability;variance decomposition of forecast errors;generalization error;variance;bias;biological classification;data analysis;active learning;semi supervised learning;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;

Choose Your Words Carefully: An Empirical Study of Feature Selection Metrics for Text Classification,George Forman (Hewlett-Packard);,2195069006,"Good feature selection is essential for text classification to make it tractable for machine learning, and to improve classification performance.

The simple application of conventional techniques developed for the support-confidence framework is not possible, since functions for correlation do not meet the anti-monotonicity property that is crucial to traditional methods. In this paper, we propose the heuristics for the vertical decomposition of a database, for pruning unproductive itemsets, and for traversing a set-enumeration tree of itemsets that is tailored to the calculation of the N most significant association rules, where N can be specified by the user.

We simulate learning scenarios of varying difficulty to demonstrate that this fundamental qualitative difference in the two mechanisms results in existence of many scenarios in which PNrule achieves comparable or significantly better performance than AdaCost, a strong cost-sensitive boosting algorithm.

We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing its performance with those of two other methods, including Xing et al.'s one of the latest feature subset selection methods. The evaluation was performed on a real-world data set with approximately 140,000 features.

Explaining individual results is accomplished by modelling each of the networks as a rule-set and computing the resulting coverage statistics for each rule given the data used to train the network. This coverage information is then used to choose the rule or rules that best describe the example under investigation.

Multiscale matching compares two subsequences throughout various scales of view. It has an advantage of preserving connectivity of subsequences even if the subsequences are represented at different scales. Rough clustering groups up objects according not to the topographic measures such as the center or deviance of objects in a cluster but to the relative similarity and indiscernibility of objects. We use multiscale matching to obtain similarity of sequences and rough clustering to cluster the sequences according to the obtained similarity. We slightly modified dissimilarity measure in multiscale matching so that it suppresses excessive shift of phase that may cause incorrect matching of the sequences. Experimental results on the hepatitis dataset show that the proposed method successfully clustered similar sequences into an independent cluster, and that correspondence of subsequences are also successfully captured.",2002,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,rough set;pattern matching;cluster analysis;time series;biological classification;data analysis;knowledge extraction;data mining;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
Finding Hidden Factors Using Independent Component Analysis,Erkki Oja (Helsinki University of Technology);,1828928408,"Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a computational technique for revealing hidden factors that underlie sets of measurements or signals. ICA assumes a statistical model whereby the observed multivariate data, typically given as a large database of samples, are assumed to be linear or nonlinear mixtures of some unknown latent variables. The mixing coefficients are also unknown. The latent variables are non-gaussian and mutually independent, and they are called the independent components of the observed data. By ICA, these independent components, also called sources or factors, can be found. Thus ICA can be seen as an extension to Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis. ICA is a much richer technique, however, capable of finding the sources when these classical methods fail completely.In many cases, the measurements are given as a set of parallel signals or time series.

Mining Hierarchical Decision Rules from Clinical Databases Using Rough Sets aaand Medical Diagnostic Model,Shusaku Tsumoto (Sofia Medical University);,122205434,"One of the most important problems on rule induction methods is that they cannot extract rules, which plausibly represent experts' decision processes. On one hand, rule induction methods induce probabilistic rules, the description length of which is too short, compared with the experts' rules. On the other hand, construction of Bayesian networks generates too lengthy rules. In this paper, the characteristics of experts' rules are closely examined and a new approach to extract plausible rules is introduced, which consists of the following three procedures. First, the characterization of decision attributes (given classes) is extracted from databases and the classes are classified into several groups with respect to the characterization. Then, two kinds of sub-rules, characterization rules for each group and discrimination rules for each class in the group are induced. Finally, those two parts are integrated into one rule for each decision attribute. The proposed method was evaluated on a medical database, the experimental results of which show that induced rules correctly represent experts' decision processes.",2002,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,bayesian network;decision rule;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;
A Scalable Constant-Memory Sampling Algorithm for Pattern Discovery in Large Databases,Tobias Scheffer (University of Potsdam);Stefan Wrobel (Advanced Info Service);,"1974974032,2113978936","Many data mining tasks can be seen as an instance of the problem of finding the most interesting (according to some utility function) patterns in a large database. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in scaling algorithms for this task to very large databases through the use of sequential sampling techniques. However, except for sampling-based greedy algorithms which cannot give absolute quality guarantees, the scalability of existing approaches to this problem is only with respect to the data, not with respect to the size of the pattern space: it is universally assumed that the entire hypothesis space fits in main memory. In this paper, we describe how this class of algorithms can be extended to hypothesis spaces that do not fit in memory while maintaining the algorithms' precise ? - ? quality guarantees. We present a constant memory algorithm for this task and prove that it possesses the required properties. In an empirical comparison, we compare variable memory and constant memory sampling.",2002,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,out of core algorithm;sequential analysis;greedy algorithm;scalability;data analysis;knowledge extraction;information extraction;data mining;database;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
Rule Induction for Classification of Gene Expression Array Data,Per Lidén;Lars Asker (Stockholm University);Henrik Bostróm (Stockholm University);,"2048106600,2089372118,2082592554","Gene expression array technology has rapidly become a standard tool for biologists. Its use within areas such as diagnostics, toxicology, and genetics, calls for good methods for finding patterns and prediction models from the generated data. Rule induction is one promising candidate method due to several attractive properties such as high level of expressiveness and interpretability. In this work we investigate the use of rule induction methods for mining gene expression patterns from various cancer types. Three different rule induction methods are evalu-tedoon two public tumor tissue data sets. The methods are shown to obtain as good prediction accuracy as the best current methods, at the same time allowing for straightforward interpretation of the prediction models. These models typically consist of small sets of simple rules, which associate a few genes and expression levels with specific types of cancer.

Iterative Data Squashing for Boosting Based on a Distribution-Sensitive Distance,Yuta Choki (Yokohama National University);Einoshin Suzuki (Yokohama National University);,"290968587,2228069075","This paper proposes, for boosting, a novel method which prevents deterioration of accuracy inherent to data squashing methods.

Data squashing, which speeds-up a learning method by abstracting the training data set to a smaller data set, typically lowers accuracy. Our SB (Squashing-Boosting) loop, based on a distribution-sensitive distance, alternates data squashing and boosting, and iteratively refines an SF (Squashed-Feature) tree, which provides an appropriately squashed data set.

Multiscale Comparison of Temporal Patternsin Time-Series Medical Databases,Shoji Hirano (Shimane University);Shusaku Tsumoto (Shimane University);,"2127173244,122205434","This paper presents a method for analyzing time-series data on laboratory examinations based on phase-constraint multiscale matching and rough clustering. Multiscale matching compares two subsequences throughout various scales of view. It has an advantage of preserving connectivity of subsequences even if the subsequences are represented at different scales. Rough clustering groups up objects according not to the topographic measures such as the center or deviance of objects in a cluster but to the relative similarity and indiscernibility of objects. We use multiscale matching to obtain similarity of sequences and rough clustering to cluster the sequences according to the obtained similarity. We slightly modified dissimilarity measure in multiscale matching so that it suppresses excessive shift of phase that may cause incorrect matching of the sequences. Experimental results on the hepatitis dataset show that the proposed method successfully clustered similar sequences into an independent cluster, and that correspondence of subsequences are also successfully captured.",2002,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,rough set;time series;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

Discovery of Temporal Patterns. Learning Rules about the Qualitative Behaviour of Time Series,Frank Höppner;,2695140036,"Recently, association rule mining has been generalized to the discovery of episodes in event sequences. In this paper, we additionally take durations into account and thus present a generalization to time intervals. We discover frequent temporal patterns in a single series of such labeled intervals, which we call a state sequence. A temporal pattern is defined as a set of states together with their interval relationships described in terms of Allen's interval logic, for instance ""A before B, A overlaps C, C overlaps B"" or equivalently ""state A ends before state B starts, the gap is covered by state C"". As an example we consider the problem of deriving local weather forecasting rules that allow us to conclude from the qualitative behaviour of the air-pressure curve to the wind-strength. Here, the states have been extracted automatically from (multivariate) time series and characterize the trend of the time series locally within the assigned time interval.",2001,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,temporal database;association rule learning;quantitative analysis;time series;data analysis;knowledge extraction;data mining;artificial intelligence;algorithm;computer science;

In a Bayesian framework, we determine the contributions of confidence and support to the expected accuracy on future data. We present a fast algorithm that finds the n best rules which maximize the resulting criterion. The algorithm dynamically prunes redundant rules and parts of the hypothesis space that cannot contain better solutions than the best ones found so far.

The two populations co-evolve, so that the final result of the co-evolutionary process is a fuzzy rule set and a set of membership function definitions which are well adapted to each other. In addition, our system also has some innovative ideas with respect to the encoding of GP individuals representing rule sets. The basic idea is that our individual encoding scheme incorporates several syntactical restrictions that facilitate the handling of rule sets in disjunctive normal form.

We motivate the use of multiple-valued implication operators in order to model fuzzy association rules and propose quality measures suitable for this type of rule. Moreover, we introduce a semantic model of fuzzy association rules which suggests to consider them as a convex combination of simple association rules.

Thus, a variety of algorithms have been proposed which have application in different fields and may result in different partitioning of a data set, depending on the specific clustering criterion used. Moreover, since clustering is an unsupervised process, most of the algorithms are based on assumptions in order to define a partitioning of a data set. It is then obvious that in most applications the final clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation. In this paper we present a clustering validity procedure, which taking in account the inherent features of a data set evaluates the results of different clustering algorithms applied to it. A validity index, S_Dbw, is defined according to well-known clustering criteria so as to enable the selection of the algorithm providing the best partitioning of a data set.

The gravity-based clustering algorithm simulates how the given N nodes in a K-dimensional continuous vector space will cluster due to the gravity force, provided that each node is associated with a mass. One of the main issues studied in this paper is how the order of the distance term in the denominator of the gravity force formula impacts clustering quality. The study reveals that, among the hierarchical clustering algorithms invoked for comparison, only the gravity-based algorithm with a high order of the distance term neither has a bias towards spherical clusters nor suffers the well-known chaining effect. Since bias towards spherical clusters and the chaining effect are two major problems with respect to clustering quality, eliminating both implies that high clustering quality is achieved.

Fusion of Meta-knowledge and Meta-data for Case-Based Model Selection,Melanie Hilario (University of Geneva);Alexandros Kalousis (University of Geneva);,"2159401048,1835498038","Meta-learning for model selection, as reported in the symbolic machine learning community, can be described as follows. First, it is cast as a purely data-driven predictive task. Second, it typically relies on a mapping of dataset characteristics to some measure of generalization performance (e.g., error). Third, it tends to ignore the role of algorithm parameters by relying mostly on default settings. This paper describes a case-based system for model selection which combines knowledge and data in selecting a (set of) algorithm(s) to recommend for a given task. The knowledge consists mainly of the similarity measures used to retrieve records of past learning experiences as well as profiles of learning algorithms incorporated into the conceptual meta-model. In addition to the usual dataset characteristics and error rates, the case base includes objects describing the evaluation strategy and the learner parameters used. These have two major roles: they ensure valid and meaningful comparisons between independently reported findings, and they facilitate replication of past experiments. Finally, the case-based meta-learner can be used not only as a predictive tool but also as an exploratory tool for gaining further insight into previously tested algorithms and datasets.",2001,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,generalization error;meta analysis;knowledge extraction;knowledge base;expert system;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;

The data encode characteristic events in a person's life course, such as their birth date, the begin and end dates of their partnerships and marriages, and the birth dates of their children. The goal is to detect significant changes in the chronology of these events over people from different birth cohorts. To solve this problem, we encoded the temporal information in a first-order logic representation, and employed Warmr, an ILP system that discovers association rules in a multi-relational data set, to detect frequent patterns that show significant variance over different birth cohorts. As a case study in multirelational association rule mining, this work illustrates the flexibility resulting from the use of first-order background knowledge, but also uncovers a number of important issues that hitherto received little attention.",2001,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,life course approach;sequential pattern mining;temporal logic;relational database;first order logic;data analysis;data processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;algorithm;computer science;
Gaphyl: A Genetic Algorithms Approach to Cladistics,Clare Bates Congdon (Colby College);,2191504433,"This research investigates the use of genetic algorithms to solve problems from cladistics - a technique used by biologists to hypothesize the evolutionary relationships between organisms. Since exhaustive search is not practical in this domain, typical cladistics software packages use heuristic search methods to navigate through the space of possible trees in an attempt to find one or more ""best"" solutions. We have developed a system called Gaphyl, which uses the genetic algorithm approach as a search technique for finding cladograms, and a tree evaluation metric from a common cladistics software package (Phylip). On a nontrivial problem (49 species with 61 attributes), Gaphyl is able to find more of the best known trees with less computational effort than Phylip is able to find (corresponding to more equally plausible evolutionary hypotheses).",2001,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,search tree;cladistics;search algorithm;genetic algorithm;data analysis;evolutionary algorithm;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Ritter (Bielefeld University);,"1851096771,2114361001","This paper introduces a new type of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for Text Categorization and Semantic Browsing. We propose a ""hyperbolic SOM"" (HSOM) based on a regular tesselation of the hyperbolic plane, which is a non-euclidean space characterized by constant negative gaussian curvature. This approach is motivated by the observation that hyperbolic spaces possess a geometry where the size of a neighborhood around a point increases exponentially and therefore provides more freedom to map a complex information space such as language into spatial relations. These theoretical findings are supported by our experiments, which show that hyperbolic SOMs can successfully be applied to text categorization and yield results comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore we demonstrate that the HSOM is able to map large text collections in a semantically meaningful way and therefore allows a ""semantic browsing"" of text databases.",2001,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,hyperbolic space;gaussian curvature;spatial relation;categorization;euclidean space;self organization;biological classification;data analysis;data visualization;semantics;computer vision;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;

The TwoKey Plot for Multiple Association Rules Control,Anthony Unwin (University of Augsburg);Heike Hofmann (AT&T);Klaus Bernt (University of Augsburg);,"2496010409,2376363302,2496776245","Association rules have been popular in theory, though it is unclear how much success they have had in practice. Very many association rules are found in any application by any approach and they require effective pruning and filtering. There has been much research in this area recently, but less with the goal of providing a global overview and summary of all rules, which may then be used to explore the rules and to evaluate their worth. The unusual feature of association rules is that those with the highest objective values for the two key criteria (support and confidence) are not usually those with the most subjective interest (because we know the obvious results already). The TwoKey plot is a way of displaying all discovered association rules at once, while also providing the means to review and manage them. It is a powerful tool in order to get a first overview of the distribution of confidence and support. Features such as separate groups of rules or outliers are detected immediately. By exploiting various ancestor relationship structures among the rules, we can use the TwoKey Plot also as a visual assessment tool, closely related to pruning methods - e.g. those proposed by Bing Liu (1999). The concept will be illustrated using the interactive software MARC (Multiple Association Rules Control).",2001,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,association rule learning;data analysis;data science;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;
Bloomy Decision Tree for Multi-objective Classification,Einoshin Suzuki (Yokohama National University);Masafumi Gotoh (Yokohama National University);Yuta Choki (Yokohama National University);,"2228069075,2283508786,290968587","This paper presents a novel decision-tree induction for a multi-objective data set, i.e. a data set with a multi-dimensional class. Inductive decision-tree learning is one of the frequently-used methods for a single-objective data set, i.e. a data set with a single-dimensional class. However, in a real data analysis, we usually have multiple objectives, and a classifier which explains them simultaneously would be useful and would exhibit higher readability. A conventional decision-tree inducer requires transformation of a multi-dimensional class into a single-dimensional class, but such a transformation can considerably worsen both accuracy and readability. In order to circumvent this problem we propose a bloomy decision tree which deals with a multi-dimensional class without such transformations. A bloomy decision tree has a set of split nodes each of which splits examples according to their attribute values, and a set of flower nodes each of which predicts a class dimension of examples. A flower node appears not only at the fringe of a tree but also inside a tree. Our pruning is executed during tree construction, and evaluates each class dimension based on CramEr's V. The proposed method has been implemented as D3-B (Decision tree in Bloom), and tested with eleven data sets. The experiments showed that D3-B has higher accuracies in nine data sets than C4.5 and tied with it in the other two data sets. In terms of readability, D3-B has a smaller number of split nodes in all data sets, and thus outperforms C4.5.",2001,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,left child right sibling binary tree;fractal tree index;incremental decision tree;exponential tree;vantage point tree;k ary tree;interval tree;range tree;segment tree;trie;search tree;multidimensional analysis;binary tree;decision tree learning;tree;tree structure;decision tree;biological classification;data analysis;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
Interestingness Measures for Fuzzy Association Rules,Attila Gyenesei (University of Turku);,2310684266,"Data mining tries to discover interesting and surprising patterns among a given data set. An important task is to develop effective measures of interestingness for evaluating and ranking the discovered patterns. A good measure should give a high rank to patterns, which have strong evidence among data, but which yet are not too obvious. Thereby the initial set of patterns can be pruned before human inspection. In this paper we study interestingness measures for generalized quantitative association rules, where the attribute domains can be fuzzy. Several interestingness measures have been developed for the discrete case, and it turns out that many of them can be generalized to fuzzy association rules, as well. More precisely, our goal is to compare the fuzzy version of confidence to some other measures, which are based on statistics and information theory. Our experiments show that although the rankings of rules are relatively similar for most of the methods, also some anomalies occur. Our suggestion is that the information-theoretic measures are a good choice when estimating the interestingness of rules, both for fuzzy and non-fuzzy domains.",2001,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,interest;association rule learning;fuzzy logic;data analysis;information extraction;data processing;information theory;data mining;pattern recognition;machine learning;statistics;computer science;mathematics;

We show how the embedded knowledge of self-similar structure can be used to reduce the complexity of learning and increase the accuracy of the learned model. Moreover, we introduce three different types of self-similarity in SSLHMM, and investigate their performance in the context of synthetic data and real-world network databases.

Support Vectors for Reinforcement Learning,Thomas G. Dietterich (Oregon State University);Xin Wang (Oregon State University);,"160031478,2436620901","Support vector machines introduced three important innovations to machine learning research: (a) the application of mathematical programming algorithms to solve optimization problems in machine learning, (b) the control of overfitting by maximizing the margin, and (c) the use of Mercer kernels to convert linear separators into non-linear decision boundaries in implicit spaces. Despite their attractiveness in classification and regression, support vector methods have not been applied to the problem of value function approximation in reinforcement learning. This paper presents three ways of combining linear programming with kernel methods to find value function approximations for reinforcement learning. One formulation is based on the standard approach to SVM regression; the second is based on the Bellman equation; and the third seeks only to ensure that good actions have an advantage over bad actions. All formulations attempt to minimize the norm of the weight vector while fitting the data, which corresponds to maximizing the margin in standard SVM classification. Experiments in a difficult, synthetic maze problem show that all three formulations give excellent performance. However, the third formulation is much more efficient to train and also converges more reliably. Unlike policy gradient and temporal difference methods, the kernel methods described here can easily adjust the complexity of the function approximator to fit the complexity of the value function.",2001,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,least squares support vector machine;kernel method;support vector machine;bellman equation;reinforcement learning;linear programming;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical optimization;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Biological Sequence Data Mining,Yuh-Jyh Hu (National Chiao Tung University);,2645003573,"Biologists have determined that the control and regulation of gene expression is primarily determined by relatively short sequences in the region surrounding a gene. These sequences vary in length, position, redundancy, orientation, and bases. Finding these short sequences is a fundamental problem in molecular biology with important applications. Though there exist many different approaches to signal/motif (i.e. short sequence) finding, in 2000 Pevzner and Sze reported that most current motif finding algorithms are incapable of detecting the target signals in their so-called Challenge Problem. In this paper, we show that using an iterative-restart design, our new algorithm can correctly find the targets. Furthermore, taking into account the fact that some transcription factors form a dimer or even more complex structures, and transcription process can sometimes involve multiple factors, we extend the original problem to an even more challenging one. We address the issue of combinatorial signals with gaps of variable lengths. To demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm, we tested it on a series of the original and the new challenge problems, and compared it with some representative motif-finding algorithms. In addition, to verify its feasibility in real-world applications, we also tested it on several regulatory families of yeast genes with known motifs. The purpose of this paper is two-fold.

Traditionally, such techniques are concentrating on the search aspects of the problem, employing algorithmic techniques to avoid searching parts of the space or to speed up processing by exploiting properties of the underlying host systems. Such techniques guarantee perfect correctness of solutions, but can never reach sublinear complexity. In contrast, researchers have recently begun to take a fresh and principled look at stochastic sampling techniques which give only an approximate quality guarantee, but can make runtimes almost independent of the size of the database at hand.

Quality Scheme Assessment in the Clustering Process,Maria Halkidi (Athens University of Economics and Business);Michalis Vazirgiannis (Athens University of Economics and Business);Yannis Batistakis (Athens University of Economics and Business);,"339332626,1914497179,1270301772","Clustering is mostly an unsupervised procedure and most of the clustering algorithms depend on assumptions and initial guesses in order to define the subgroups presented in a data set. As a consequence, in most applications the final clusters require some sort of evaluation. The evaluation procedure has to tackle difficult problems, which can be qualitatively expressed as: i. quality of clusters, ii. the degree with which a clustering scheme fits a specific data set, iii. the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In this paper we present a scheme for finding the optimal partitioning of a data set during the clustering process regardless of the clustering algorithm used. More specifically, we present an approach for evaluation of clustering schemes (partitions) so as to find the best number of clusters, which occurs in a specific data set. A clustering algorithm produces different partitions for different values of the input parameters. The proposed approach selects the best clustering scheme (i.e., the scheme with the most compact and well-separated clusters), according to a quality index we define. We verified our approach using two popular clustering algorithms on synthetic and real data sets in order to evaluate its reliability.

In this paper, we propose a structure called free-sets, from which we can approximate any itemset support (i.e., the number of transactions containing the itemset) and we formalize this notion in the framework of Ɛ-adequate representation [10]. We show that frequent free-sets can be efficiently extracted using pruning strategies developed for frequent item-set discovery, and that they can be used to approximate the support of any frequent itemset. Experiments run on real dense data sets show a significant reduction of the size of the output when compared with standard frequent itemsets extraction. Furthermore, the experiments show that the extraction of frequent free-sets is still possible when the extraction of frequent itemsets becomes intractable. Finally, we show that the error made when approximating frequent itemset support remains very low in practice.",2000,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,association rule learning;information extraction;approximation algorithm;information processing;data mining;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Improving an Association Rule Based Classifier,Bing Liu (National University of Singapore);Yiming Ma (National University of Singapore);Ching Kian Wong (National University of Singapore);,"2244698799,2135577480,2142468440","Existing classification algorithms in machine learning mainly use heuristic search to find a subset of regularities in data for classification. In the past few years, extensive research was done in the database community on learning rules using exhaustive search under the name of association rule mining. Although the whole set of rules may not be used directly for accurate classification, effective classifiers have been built using the rules. This paper aims to improve such an exhaustive search based classification system CBA (Classification Based on Associations). The main strength of this system is that it is able to use the most accurate rules for classification. However, it also has weaknesses. This paper proposes two new techniques to deal with these weaknesses. This results in remarkably accurate classifiers. Experiments on a set of 34 benchmark datasets show that on average the new techniques reduce the error of CBA by 17% and is superior to CBA on 26 of the 34 datasets. They reduce the error of C4.5 by 19%, and improve performance on 29 datasets.

Context-Based Similarity Measures for Categorical Databases,Gautam Das (Microsoft);Heikki Mannila (Aalto University);,"2112689123,310734946","Similarity between complex data objects is one of the central notions in data mining. We propose certain similarity (or distance) measures between various components of a 0/1 relation. We define measures between attributes, between rows, and between subrelations of the database. They find important applications in clustering, classification, and several other data mining processes. Our measures are based on the contexts of individual components. For example, two products (i.e., attributes) are deemed similar if their respective sets of customers (i.e., subrelations) are similar. This reveals more subtle relationships between components, something that is usually missing in simpler measures. Our problem of finding distance measures can be formulated as a system of nonlinear equations. We present an iterative algorithm which, when seeded with random initial values, converges quickly to stable distances in practice (typically requiring less than five iterations). The algorithm requires only one database scan. Results on artificial and real data show that our method is efficient, and produces results with intuitive appeal.",2000,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,complex data type;categorical variable;information system;knowledge representation and reasoning;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;programming language;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

An extensive experimental evaluation of the new algorithm is performed on twenty-one data sets, combining models generated by five learning algorithms: two algorithms for learning decision trees, a rule learning algorithm, a nearest neighbor algorithm and a naive Bayes algorithm.

Zoomed Ranking: Selection of Classification Algorithms Based on Relevant Performance Information,Carlos Soares (University of Porto);Pavel B.

In this paper we present a combination of techniques to address this problem. The first one, zooming, analyzes a given dataset and selects relevant (similar) datasets that were processed by the candidate algoritms in the past. This process is based on the concept of ""distance"", calculated on the basis of several dataset characteristics. The information about the performance of the candidate algorithms on the selected datasets is then processed by a second technique, a ranking method. Such a method uses performance information to generate advice in the form of a ranking, indicating which algorithms should be applied in which order. Here we propose the adjusted ratio of ratios ranking method. This method takes into account not only accuracy but also the time performance of the candidate algorithms. The generalization power of this ranking method is analyzed. For this purpose, an appropriate methodology is defined.

Instance-Based Classification by Emerging Patterns,Jinyan Li1 (University of Melbourne);Guozhu Dong (Wright State University);Kotagiri Ramamohanarao (University of Melbourne);,"2190567876,2164298414,123309386","Emerging patterns (EPs), namely itemsets whose supports change significantly from one class to another, capture discriminating features that sharply contrast instances between the classes. Recently, EP-based classifiers have been proposed, which first mine as many EPs as possible (called eager-learning) from the training data and then aggregate the discriminating power of the mined EPs for classifying new instances. We propose here a new, instance-based classifier using EPs, called DeEPs, to achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than the previously proposed EP-based classifiers. High accuracy is achieved because the instance-based approach enables DeEPs to pinpoint all EPs relevant to a test instance, some of which are missed by the eager-learning approaches. High efficiency is obtained using a series of data reduction and concise data-representation techniques. Experiments show that DeEPs' decision time is linearly scalable over the number of training instances and nearly linearly over the number of attributes. Experiments on 40 datasets also show that DeEPs is superior to other classifiers on accuracy.",2000,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,external data representation;data reduction;knowledge representation and reasoning;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Here we return to the ""classic"" problem, namely the efficient generation of all association rules that exist in a given set of transactions with respect to minimum support and minimum confidence. From our point of view, the performance problem concerning this task is still not adequately solved. In this paper we address two topics: First of all, today there is no satisfying comparison of the common algorithms. Therefore we identify the fundamental strategies of association rule mining and present a general framework that is independent of any particular approach and its implementation. Based on this we carefully analyze the algorithms. We explain differences and similarities in performance behavior and complete our theoretic insights by runtime experiments. Second, the results are quite surprising and enable us to derive a new algorithm. This approach avoids the identified pitfalls and at the same time profits from the strengths of known approaches.

Bagging and Boosting with Dynamic Integration of Classifiers,Alexey Tsymbal (University of Jyväskylä);Seppo Puuronen (University of Jyväskylä);,"2062554273,1965931980","One approach in classification tasks is to use machine learning techniques to derive classifiers using learning instances.

The main current decision committee learning approaches boosting and bagging use resampling with the training set and they can be used with different machine learning techniques which derive base classifiers. Boosting uses a kind of weighted voting and bagging uses equal weight voting as a combining method. Both do not take into account the local aspects that the base classifiers may have inside the problem space. We have proposed a dynamic integration technique to be used with ensembles of classifiers.

Applying Objective Interestingness Measures in Data Mining Systems,Robert J. Hilderman (University of Regina);Howard J. Hamilton (University of Regina);,"2170316634,2196958594","One of the most important steps in any knowledge discovery task is the interpretation and evaluation of discovered patterns. To address this problem, various techniques, such as the chi-square test for independence, have been suggested to reduce the number of patterns presented to the user and to focus attention on those that are truly statistically significant. However, when mining a large database, the number of patterns discovered can remain large even after adjusting significance thresholds to eliminate spurious patterns. What is needed, then, is an effective measure to further assist in the interpretation and evaluation step that ranks the interestingness of the remaining patterns prior to presenting them to the user. In this paper, we describe a two-step process for ranking the interestingness of discovered patterns that utilizes the chi-square test for independence in the first step and objective measures of interestingness in the second step. We show how this two-step process can be applied to ranking characterized/generalized association rules and data cubes.",2000,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,chi square test;association rule learning;information system;information processing;data science;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;computer science;mathematics;

Fast Hierarchical Clustering Based on Compressed Data and OPTICS,Markus M.

Such compressed data records can e.g. be produced by the BIRCH algorithm. Typically they consist of the sufficient statistics of the form (N, X, X2) where N is the number of points, X is the (vector-)sum, and X2 is the square sum of the points. They can be used directly to speed up k-means type of clustering algorithms, but it is not obvious how to use them in a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm e.g. to the centers of compressed subclusters produces a very weak result. The reason is that hierarchical clustering algorithms are based on the distances between data points and that the interpretaion of the result relies heavily on a correct graphical representation of these distances. In this paper, we introduce a method by which the sufficient statistics (N, X, X2) of sub-clusters can be utilized in the hierarchical clustering method OPTICS. We show how to generate appropriate distance information about compressed data points, and how to adapt the graphical representation of the clustering result.

In this decision model different rules can be incorporated: either those obtained by applying one or more inductive learning algorithms or even rules representing human encoded expert domain knowledge.

Materialized data mining views store selected patterns discovered in a portion of a database, and are used for query rewriting, which transforms a data mining query into a query accessing a materialized view. Since the transformation is transparent to a user, materialized data mining views can be created and used like indexes.",2000,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,view;materialized view;association rule learning;relational database;data stream mining;decision support system;information processing;information retrieval;data mining;database;computer science;

Basis of Fuzzy Knowledge Discovery System,Maurice Bernadet (IRIN);,2471826833,"Considering a fuzzy knowledge discovery system we have realized we describe here the main features of such systems.

We describe then one algorithm use to extract fuzzy rules. Since many fuzzy operators are available, we propose a method to choose one fuzzy conjunction, one fuzzy implication and one fuzzy aggregation, and we explain how this choice may be validated by comparing the results of the Generalized Modus Ponens applied on the premises of the examples to the effective conclusions in the database. To reduce the important number of fuzzy rules extracted, we consider also some methods to aggregate fuzzy rules, showing that usage of classical reduction schemes requires specific choices of fuzzy operators.",2000,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy transportation;type 2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy measure theory;fuzzy mathematics;defuzzification;modus ponens;fuzzy cognitive map;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy classification;fuzzy number;membership function;neuro fuzzy;probabilistic logic;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;knowledge extraction;information extraction;fuzzy control system;information processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

A Genetic Algorithm-Based Solution for the Problem of Small Disjuncts,Deborah R.

Unified Algorithm for Undirected Discovery of Execption Rules,Einoshin Suzuki (Yokohama National University);Jan M. Zytkow (University of North Carolina at Charlotte);,"2228069075,2090313169","This paper presents an algorithm that seeks every possible exception rule which violates a common sense rule and satisfies several assumptions of simplicity. Exception rules, which represent systematic deviation from common sense rules, are often found interesting. Discovery of pairs that consist of a common sense rule and an exception rule, resulting from undirected search for unexpected exception rules, was successful in various domains. In the past, however, an exception rule represented a change of conclusion caused by adding an extra condition to the premise of a common sense rule. That approach formalized only one type of exceptions, and failed to represent other types. In order to provide a systematic treatment of exceptions, we categorize exception rules into eleven categories, and we propose a unified algorithm for discovering all of them. Preliminary results on fifteen real-world data sets provide an empirical proof of effectiveness of our algorithm in discovering interesting knowledge.

Efficient Score-Based Learning of Equivalence Classes of Bayesian Networks,Paul Munteanu (ESIEA);Denis Cau (ESIEA);,"2094895817,2643172877","The use of bayesian networks for knowledge discovery requires learning algorithms which emphasize not only the predictive power but also the structural fidelity of the discovered networks.

However, they are considerably slower, mainly because they use more complicated search operators and because they have to build instances of the equivalence classes in order to check their consistency and in order to calculate their score. We propose here a new greedy learning algorithm that explores the space of equivalence classes with a reduced set of operators and realizes the verification of the consistency and the computation of the score without any need for instantiation.

Traditionally the categories are arranged in hierarchical manner to achieve effective searching and indexing as well as easy comprehension for human. The determination of categories and their hierarchical structures were most done by human experts. In this work, we developed an approach to automatically generate categories and reveal the hierarchical structure among them. We also used the generated structure to categorize text documents. The document collection is trained by a self-organizing map to form two feature maps. We then analyzed the two maps to obtain the categories and the structure among them.

In this paper we describe an approach which uses UML as the common specification language for a large range of ILP engines. Having such a common language will enable a wide range of users, including non-experts, to model problems and apply different engines without any extra effort.

A Mixed Similarity Measure in Near-Linear Computational Complexity for Distance-Based Methods,Ngoc Binh Nguyen (Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology);Tu Bao Ho (Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology);,"2144311550,2135463138","Many methods of knowledge discovery and data mining are distance-based such as nearest neighbor classification or clustering where similarity measures between objects play an essential role. While real-world databases are often heterogeneous with mixed numeric and symbolic attributes, most available similarity measures can only be applied to either symbolic or numeric data. In such cases, data mining methods often require transforming numeric data into symbolic ones by discretization techniques. Mixed similarity measures (MSMs) without discretization of numeric values are desirable alternatives for objects with mixed symbolic and numeric data. However, the time and space complexities of computing available MSMs are often very high that make MSMs not applicable to large datasets. In the framework of Goodall's MSM inspired by biological taxonomy, computing methods have been done but their time and space complexities so far are at least O(n2 log n2) and O(n2), respectively. In this work, we propose a new and efficient method for computing this MSM with O(n log n) time and O(n) space complexities. We demonstrate experimentally the applicability of new method to large datasets and suggest meta-knowledge on the use of this MSM. Practically, the experimental results show that only the near-linear time and space MSM could be applicable to mining large heterogeneous datasets.",2000,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,dspace;symbolic data analysis;time complexity;information system;computational complexity theory;knowledge representation and reasoning;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Initial experiments suggest that genes with similar function have similar expression patterns in microarray experiments. Until now, most approaches to computational analysis of gene expressions have used unsupervised learning. Although in some cases unsupervised methods may be sufficient, the complexity of the biological processes is so high that it is unlikely that purely syntactical analyses are capable of fully exploiting the richness of the microarray data. In addition, it seems natural to re-use the existing biological (background) knowledge. In this paper, we present some elements of a methodology for knowledge discovery from microarray experiments. Two source of bio-medical knowledge are used: Ashburner's gene ontology and our own literature-derived network of gene-gene relations obtained by analysing Medline citation records.

The application of this method is discussed in the context of switching control. Switching (or discrete event) control of continuous systems consists in changing the structure of a system in such a way as to control its behavior.

At the same time, many other efficient selection algorithms have been developed in order to reduce storage requirments of case-based learning algorithms. Therefore, their original aim is not the tree simplification. Surprisingly, as far as we know, few works have attempted to exploit this wealth of efficient algorithms in favor of knowledge discovery.

Discovery of Ambiguous Patterns in Sequences: Application to Bioinformatics,Gerard Ramstein (École Polytechnique);Pascal Bunelle (École Polytechnique);Yannick Jacques (French Institute of Health and Medical Research);,"2052848746,2398600034,2012814669","An important issue in data mining concerns the discovery of patterns presenting a user-specified minimum support. We generalize this problematics by introducing the concept of ambiguous event. An ambiguous event can be substituated for another without modifying the substance of the concerned pattern. For instance, in molecular biology, researchers attempt to identify conserved patterns in a family of proteins for which they know that they have evolved from a common ancestor. Such patterns are flexible in the sense that some residues may have been substituated for others during evolution. A[B C] is an example of notation of an ambiguous pattern representing the event A, followed by either the event B or C. A new scoring scheme is proposed for the computation of the frequency of ambiguous patterns, based on substitution matrices. A substitution matrix expresses the probability of the replacement of an event by another. We propose to adapt the Winepi algorithm [1] to ambiguous events.

Expert Constrained Clustering: A Symbolic Approach,Fabrice Rossi (Télécom ParisTech);Frédérick Vautrain;,"2101287777,2378420045","A new constrained model is discussed as a way of incorporating efficiently a priori expert knowledge into a clustering problem of a given individual set. The first innovation is the combination of fusion constraints, which request some individuals to belong to one cluster, with exclusion constraints, which separate some individuals in different clusters. This situation implies to check the existence of a solution (ie if no pair of individuals are connected by fusion and exclusion constraints). The second novelty is that the constraints are expressed in a symbolic language that allows compact description of group of individuals according to a given interpretation. This paper studies the coherence of such constraints at individual and symbolic levels. A mathematical framework, close to the Symbolic Data Analysis[3], is built in order to define how a symbolic description space may be interpreted on a given individual set. A partial order on symbolic descriptions (which is an usual assumption of Artificial Intelligence), allows a symbolic analysis of the constraints.

An instance is then represented by a set of items, each of which indicates whether a specific linear subgraph is contained within the graph of the instance. The cascade model is a rule induction method that uses levelwise expansion of a lattice. The basic assumption of this mining process is that characteristic subgraphs may be well represented by the concurrent appearance of linear subgraphs.

Mining Weighted Association Rules for Fuzzy Quantitative Items,Attila Gyenesei (Turku Centre for Computer Science);,2225360238,"During the last ten years, data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in databases, has established its position as a prominent and important research area. Mining association rules is one of the important research problems in data mining. Many algorithms have been proposed to find association rules in large databases containing both categorical and quantitative attributes. We generalize this to the case where part of attributes are given weights to reflect their importance to the user. In this paper, we introduce the problem of mining weighted quantitative association rules based on fuzzy approach. Using the fuzzy set concept, the discovered rules are more understandable to a human. We propose two different definitions of weighted support: with and with- out normalization. In the normalized case, a subset of a frequent itemset may not be frequent, and we cannot generate candidate k-itemsets simply from the frequent (k-1)-itemsets. We tackle this problem by using the concept of z-potential frequent subset for each candidate itemset. We give an algorithm for mining such quantitative association rules.

Some enhancements of decision tree bagging,Pierre Geurts (University of Liège);,2064583791,"This paper investigates enhancements of decision tree bagging which mainly aim at improving computation times, but also accuracy. The three questions which are reconsidered are: discretization of continuous attributes, tree pruning, and sampling schemes. A very simple discretization procedure is proposed, resulting in a dramatic speedup without significant decrease in accuracy. Then a new method is proposed to prune an ensemble of trees in a combined fashion, which is significantly more effective than individual pruning. Finally, different resampling schemes are considered leading to different CPU time/accuracy tradeoffs. Combining all these enhancements makes it possible to apply tree bagging to very large datasets, with computational performances similar to single tree induction. Simulations are carried out on two synthetic databases and four real-life datasets.",2000,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,incremental decision tree;information integration;decision tree;information processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;

Instead, it is a property that applies to a certain degree to each object in a data set, depending on how 'isolated' this object is, with respect to the surrounding clustering structure. In this paper, we formally introduce a new notion of outliers which bases outlier detection on the same theoretical foundation as density-based cluster analysis. Our notion of an outlier is 'local' in the sense that the outlier-degree of an object is determined by taking into account the clustering structure in a bounded neighborhood of the object. We demonstrate that this notion of an outlier is more appropriate for detecting different types of outliers than previous approaches, and we also present an algorithm for finding them. Furthermore, we show that by combining the outlier detection with a density-based method to analyze the clustering structure, we can get the outliers almost for free if we already want to perform a cluster analysis on a data set.",1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,ransac;outlier;information system;cluster analysis;information processing;data mining;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

To allow the use of such algorithms on non-standard databases, such as databases of financial time series, their similarity measure has to be defined. We present a simple and powerful technique which allows for the rapid evaluation of similarity between time series in large data bases. It is based on the orthonormal decomposition of the time series into the Haar basis. We demonstrate that this approach is capable of providing estimates of the local slope of the time series in the sequence of multi-resolution steps. The Haar representation and a number of related represenations derived from it are suitable for direct comparison, e.g. evaluation of the correlation product.

Although initially motivated by the desire to analyse large retail transaction databases, the general utility of association rules makes them applicable to a wide range of different learning tasks. However, association rules do not accommodate the temporal relationships that may be intrinsically important within some application domains. In this paper, we present an extension to association rules to accommodate temporal semantics. By finding associated items first and then looking for temporal relationships between them, it is possible to incorporate potentially valuable temporal semantics. Our approach to temporal reasoning accommodates both point-based and interval-based models of time simultaneously. In addition, the use of a generalized taxonomy of temporal relationships supports the generalization of temporal relationships and their specification at different levels of abstraction.

The heuristics are based upon well-known measures of diversity, dispersion, dominance, and inequality used in several areas of the physical, social, ecological, management, information, and computer sciences. Their use for ranking summaries generated from databases is a new application area.

In contrast to them, EDRL-MD simultaneously searches for threshold values for all continuous-valued attributes, when inducing decision rules. We call this approach multivariate discretization. Since multivariate discretization is able to capture interdependencies between attributes it may improve the accuracy of obtained rules.

Extension to C-means Algorithm for the Use of Similarity Functions,Javier Raymundo García-Serrano;José Francisco Martínez Trinidad (Instituto Politécnico Nacional);,"2643758041,2640184678","The C-Means algorithm has been motive of many extensions since the first publications. The extensions until now consider mainly the following aspects: the selection of initial seeds (centers); the determination of the optimal number of clusters and the use of different functionals for generate the clusters. In this paper it is proposed an extension to the C-means algorithm which considers description of the objects (data) with quantitative and qualitative features, besides consider missing data. These types of descriptions are very frequent in soft sciences as Medicine, Geology, Sociology, Marketing, etc. so the application scope for the proposed algorithm is very wide. The proposed algorithm use similarity functions that may be in function of partial similarity functions consequently allows comparing objects analyzing subdescriptions of the same. Results using standard public databases [2] are showed. In addition, a comparison with classical C-Means algorithm [7] is provided.",1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,missing data;information system;information processing;artificial intelligence;statistics;algorithm;mathematics;
Rule Induction in Cascade Model Based on Sum of Squares Decomposition,Takashi Okada (Kwansei Gakuin University);,2118848067,"A cascade model is a rule induction methodology using levelwise expansion of an itemset lattice, where the explanatory power of a rule set and its constituent rules are quantitatively expressed. The sum of squares for a categorical variable has been decomposed to within-group and between-group sum of squares, where the latter provides a good representation of the power concept in a cascade model. Using the model, we can readily derive discrimination and characteristic rules that explain as much of the sum of squares as possible. Plural rule sets are derived from the core to the outskirts of knowledge. The sum of squares criterion can be applied in any rule induction system. The cascade model was implemented as DISCAS.

While most work on KDD has been concerned with structured databases, there has been little work on handling the huge amount of information that is available only in unstructured textual form, Given a collection of text documents, most approaches to text mining perform knowledge-discovery operations on labels associated with each document. At one extreme, these labels are that represent the results of non-trivial keyword-labeling processes, and, at the other extreme, these labels are nothing more than a list of the words within the documents of interest. This paper presents an intermediate approach, one that we call text mining via information extraction, in which knowledge discovery takes place on a more focused collection of events and phrases that are extracted from and label each document. These events plus additional higher-level entities are then organized in a hierarchical taxonomy and are used in the knowledge discovery process. This approach was implemented in the Textoscope system. Textoscope cpnsists of a document retrieval module which converts retrieved documents from their native formats into SGML documents used by Textoscope; an information extraction engine, which is based on a powerful attribute grammar which is augmented by a rich background knowledge; a taxonomy-creation tool by which the user can help specify higher-level entities that inform the knowledge-discovery process; and a set of knowledge-discovery tools for the resulting event-labeled documents. We evaluate our approach on a collection of newswire stories extracted by Textoscope's own agent. Our results confirm that Text Mining via information extraction serves as an accurate and powerful technique by which to manage knowledge encapsulated in large document collections.",1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,attribute grammar;document processing;information system;knowledge extraction;document retrieval;information extraction;text mining;information processing;information retrieval;data mining;database;machine learning;computer science;

We reduce the bias by extending the set of basis polynomials for better agreement with the examples. Possible overfitting due to the reduced bias is conteracted by a variance component, implemented as a regularizing factor of the error in an MDL fitness function. Experimental results demonstrate that regularized iGP discovers accurate, parsimonious, and predictive polynomials when trained on practical data mining tasks.",1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,fitness function;information system;multivariate analysis;genetic algorithm;information processing;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Mining Possibilistic Set-Valued Rules by Generating Prime Disjunctions,Alexandr A.

The table semantics is supposed to be represented by a frequency distribution, which is interpreted with the help of minimum and maximum operations as a possibility distribution over the corresponding finite multidimensional space. This distribution is approximated by a number of possibilistic prime disjunctions, which represent the strongest patterns. We present an original formal framework generalising the conventional boolean approach on the case of (i) finite-valued variables and (ii) continuos-valued semantics, and propose a new algorithm, called Optimist, for the computationally difficult dual transformation which generates all the strongest prime disjunctions (possibilistic patterns) given a table of data.

In several applications, it is also desirable to synthesize models that in addition have good descriptive properties. The ultimate goal therefore, is to maximize both properties, i.e. to obtain models that are amenable to human inspection and that have high predictive performance. Models consisting of decision or classification rules, such as those produced with rough sets [19], can exhibit both properties. In practice, however, the induced models are often too large to be inspected. This paper reports on two basic approaches to obtaining manageable rule-based models that do not sacrifice their predictive qualities: a priori and a posteriori pruning. The methods are discussed in the context of rough sets, but several of the results are applicable to rule-based models in general.

However, this new boosted strategy needs the construction at each step of many learners, leading to high computational costs. We focus then, in a second part, on how to speed-up boosting convergence to reduce this complexity. We propose a new update of the instance distribution, which is the core of a boosting algorithm. We exploit these results to implement a new forward selection algorithm which converges much faster using overbiased distributions over learning instances.

Handling Missing Data in Trees: Surrogate Splits or Statistical Imputation,A. J.

We investigate simulation-based data augmentation to handle missing data, which is based on filling-in (imputing) one or more plausible values for the missing data. One advantage of this approach is that the imputation phase is separated from the analysis phase, allowing for different data mining algorithms to be applied to the completed data sets. We compare the use of imputation to surrogate splits, such as used in CART, to handle missing data in tree-based mining algorithms. Experiments show that imputation tends to outperform surrogate splits in terms of predictive accuracy of the resulting models.

In classification problems, a common partition ranking method is to use an attribute evaluation function to assign a goodness score to each candidate. Optimal cut point selection constitutes a potential efficiency bottleneck, which is often circumvented by using heuristic methods. This paper aims at improving the efficiency of optimal multisplitting. We analyze convex and cumulative evaluation functions, which account for the majority of commonly used goodness criteria. We derive an analytical bound, which lets us filter out-when searching for the optimal multisplit-all partitions containing a specific subpartition as their prefix. Thus, the search space of the algorithm can be restricted without losing optimality. We compare the partition candidate pruning algorithm with the best existing optimization algorithms for multisplitting.

We consider association rules of the form Λ n j=1 (A ij = v j ) → C 2 , where {A i1 ,A i A in } is a subset of the categorical attributes of the underlying relation R, and C 2 is any fixed condition defined over the attributes of the relation R. An instantiation of the rule binds the variables v j 's to values from the corresponding attribute domains. We study several problems, in which we seek a collection of instantiations of a given rule that satisfy certain optimality constraints. Each of the problems can re-interpreted as looking for one optimized disjunctive association rule. We exhibit efficient algorithms for solving the optimized support and optimized confidence problems, the weighted support/confidence problem, and the shortest rule problem. We discuss time and space complexity of the designed algorithms and show how they can be improved by allowing for approximate solutions.",1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,association rule learning;dynamic programming;information system;satisfiability;information processing;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

A Comparison of Model Selection Procedures for Predicting Turning Points in Financial Time Series,Thorsten Poddig (University of Bremen);Claus Huber (University of Bremen);,"87015320,2699659870","The aim of this paper is to compare the influence of different model selection criteria on the performance of ARMA- and VAR-models to predict turning points in nine financial time series. As the true data generating process (DGP) in general is unknown, so is the model that mimics the DGP. In order to find the model which fits the data best, we conduct data mining by estimating a multitude of models and selecting the best one optimizing a well-defined model selection criterion. In the focus of interest are two simple in-sample criteria (AIC 1 , SIC) and a more complicated out-of-sample model selection procedure. We apply Analysis of Variance to assess which selection criterion produces the best forecasts. Our results indicate that there are no differences in the predictive quality when alternative model selection criteria are used.",1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,temporal database;vector autoregression;model selection;information system;analysis of variance;strategic planning;information processing;econometrics;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;
A Divise Initialisation Method for Clustering Algorithms,Clara Pizzuti (National Research Council);Domenico Talia (University of Calabria);Giorgio Vonella;,"54675057,1976489361,2278316012",A method for the initialisation step of clustering algorithms is presented. It is based on the concept of cluster as a high density region of points. The search space is modelled as a set of d-dimensional cells. A sample of points is chosen and located into the appropriate cells. Cells are iteratively split as the number of points they receive increases. The regions of the search space having a higher density of points are considered good candidates to contain the true centers of the clusters. Preliminary experimental results show the good quality of the estimated centroids with respect to the random choice of points. The accuracy of the clusters obtained by running the K-Means algorithm with the two different initialisation techniques - random starting centers chosen uniformly on the datasets and centers found by our method - is evaluated and the better outcome of the K-Means by using our initialisation method is shown.,1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,information system;data analysis;information processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Enhancing Rule Interestingness for Neuro-fuzzy Systems,Thomas Wittmann (University of Jena);Johannes Ruhland (University of Jena);Matthias Eichholz (University of Jena);,"2064763876,2251292339,2476868935","Data Mining Algorithms extract patterns from large amounts of data. But these patterns will yield knowledge only if they are interesting, i.e. valid, new, potentially useful, and understandable. Unfortunately, during pattern search most Data Mining Algorithms focus on validity only, which also holds true for Neuro-Fuzzy Systems. In this Paper we introduce a method to enhance the interestingness of a rule base as a whole. In the first step, we aggregate the rule base through amalgamation of adjacent rules and eliminiation of redundant attributes. Supplementing this rather technical approach, we next sort rules with regard to their performance, as measured by their evidence. Finally, we compute reduced evidences, which penalize rules that are very similar to rules with a higher evidence. Rules sorted on reduced evidence are fed into an integrated rulebrowser, to allow for manual rule selection according to personal and situation-dependent preference. This method was applied successfully to two real-life classification problems, the target group selection for a retail bank, and fault diagnosis for a large car manufacturer. Explicit reference is taken to the NEFCLASS algorithm, but the procedure is easily generalized to other systems.",1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,retail banking;group selection;pattern search;association rule learning;information system;information processing;computer security;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;

This shifting ability allows to reduce the risk of deviating from valuable concepts during the induction. As an example, in a previously used simulated noisy dataset, the algorithm managed to find systematically the target concept itself, when using an adequate concept representation.

"ZigZag, a New Clustering Algorithm to Analyze Categorical Variable Cross-Classification Tables",Stéphane Lallich (University of Lyon);,248929170,"This paper proposes ZigZag, a new clustering algorithm, that works on categorical variable cross-classification tables. Zigzag creates simultaneously two partitions of row and column categories in accordance with the equivalence relation to have the same conditional mode. These two partitions are associated one to one and onto, creating by that way row-column clusters. Thus, we have an efficient KDD tool which we can apply to any database. Moreover, ZigZag visualizes predictive association for nominal data in the sense of Guttman, Goodman and Kruskal. Accordingly, the prediction rule of a nominal variable Y conditionally to an other X consists in choosing the conditionally most probable category of Y when knowing X and the power of this rule is evaluated by the mean proportional reduction in error denoted by λ Y/X . It would appear then that the mapping furnished by ZigZag plays for nominal data the same role as the scattered diagram and the curves of conditional means or the straight regression line plays for quantitative data, the first increased with the values of λ Y/X and λ X/Y , the second increased with the correlation ratio or the R 2 .",1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,equivalence relation;information system;information extraction;information processing;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Query Languages for Knowledge Discovery in Databases,Jean-François Boulicaut (Institut national des sciences Appliquées de Lyon);,1971530415,"Discovering knowledge from data appears as a complex iterative and interactive process containing many steps: understanding the data, preparing the data set, discovering potentially interesting patterns (mining phase), postprocessing of discovered patterns and finally putting the results in use. Different kinds of patterns might be used and therefore different data mining techniques are needed (e.g., association and episode rules for alarm analysis, clusters and decision trees for sales data analysis, inclusion and functional dependencies for database reverse engineering, etc). This tutorial adresses the challenge of supporting KDD processes following a querying approach. Following Imielinski and Mannila [6], second generation data mining systems might support the whole process by means of powerful query languages. We propose not only a state of the art in that field but also introduce a research perspective, the so-called inductive database framework [3]. It is out of the scope of our presentation to consider coupling architectures between data mining algorithms and database management systems. Instead, we focuse on user written queries that capture their needs during a KDD process. The popular association rules mining processes is used to illustrate most of the concepts. The use of query languages to select data for a mining task seems obvious. However, crucial issues like cleaning, sampling, supporting multidimensional data manipulation or on-line analytical processing queries when preparing a data set are still to be discussed. Indeed, available query languages offer a rather poor support for that. Next, mining phases quite often provide a huge amount of extracted patterns though just a few of them can be of practical interest for the end-user. Within the rule mining domain, one copes with that problem by selecting patterns w.r.t. interestingness measures, objective ones (e.g., confidence [1], J-measure [10], conviction [5]) or subjective ones (e.g., templates [2] or more generally queries). Indeed, it is possible to use standard query languages like SQL3 or OQL to query rule databases and perform typical postprocessing like inclusive/exclusive selection of rules or rule cover computations (elimination of redundancy).",1999,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,reverse engineering;query language;association rule learning;decision tree;information system;functional dependency;data analysis;data stream mining;data science;operating system;computer security;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;programming language;algorithm;computer science;

Dependencies may be expressed by means of formulas (implications) in the following way: {x 1 x n } ⇒ ρ {y} where {x 1 x n } are attributes that induce partitions into equivalence classes on the underlying population. Coefficient ρ is the dependency degree, it establishes the percentage of objects that can be correctly assigned to classes of y, taking into account the classification induced by {x 1 ,…,x n }. Dealing with decision tables, it is important to determine ρ and to eliminate from {x 1 x n } redundant attributes, to obtain minimal reducts having the same classification power as the original set. The problem of reduct extraction is NP-hard. Thus, approximative reducts are often determined. Reducts have the same classification power of the original set of attributes but quite often contain redundant attributes. The main idea developed in this paper is that attributes considered as random variables related by means of a dependency, are also correlated (the opposite, in general, is not true). From this fact we try to find, making use of well stated and widely used statistical methods, only the most significant variables, that is to say, the variables that contribute the most (in a quantitative sense) to determine y.

Regression by Feature Projections,Ilhan Uysal (Bilkent University);H. Altay Güvenir (Bilkent University);,"2134266845,421612369","This paper describes a machine learning method, called Regression on Feature Projections (RFP), for predicting a real-valued target feature, given the values of multiple predictive features. In RFP training is based on simply storing the projections of the training instances on each feature separately. Prediction of the target value for a query point is obtained through two averaging procedures executed sequentially. The first averaging process is to find the individual predictions of features by using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The second averaging process combines the predictions of all features. During the first averaging step, each feature is associated with a weight in order to determine the prediction ability of the feature at the local query point. The weights, found for each local query point, are used in the second prediction step and enforce the method to have an adaptive or context-sensitive nature.

Discovery of Surprising Exception Rules Based on Intensity of Implication,Einoshin Suzuki (Yokohama National University);Yves Kodratoff (University of Paris);,"2228069075,2342570814","This paper presents an algorithm for discovering surprising exception rules from data sets. An exception rule, which is defined as a deviational pattern to a common sense, exhibits unexpectedness and is sometimes extremely useful. A domain-independent approach, PEDRE, exists for the simultaneous discovery of exception rules and their common sense rules. However, PEDRE, being too conservative, have difficulty in discovering surprising rules. Historic exception discoveries show that surprise is often linked with interestingness. In order to formalize this notion we propose a novel approach by improving PEDRE. First, we reformalize the problem and settle a looser constraints on the reliability of an exception rule. Then, in order to screen out uninteresting rules, we introduce, for an exception rule, an evaluation criterion of surprise by modifying intensity of implication, which is based on significance. Our approach has been validated using data sets from the UCI repository.",1998,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,rule of inference;information system;information processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;algorithm;computer science;

Inducing Cost-Sensitive Trees via Instance Weighting,Kai Ming Ting (Deakin University);,2121496889,"We introduce an instance-weighting method to induce cost-sensitive trees in this paper. It is a generalization of the standard tree induction process where only the initial instance weights determine the type of tree to be induced-minimum error trees or minimum high cost error trees. We demonstrate that it can be easily adapted to an existing tree learning algorithm. Previous research gave insufficient evidence to support the fact that the greedy divide-and-conquer algorithm can effectively induce a truly cost-sensitive tree directly from the training data. We provide this empirical evidence in this paper. The algorithm incorporating the instance-weighting method is found to be better than the original algorithm in terms of total misclassification costs, the number of high cost errors and tree size in two-class datasets. The instance-weighting method is simpler and more effective in implementation than a previous method based on altered priors.",1998,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,fractal tree index;incremental decision tree;id3 algorithm;interval tree;divide and conquer algorithms;greedy algorithm;empirical evidence;information system;biological classification;information processing;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

A Metric for Selection of the Most Promising Rules,Pedro Gago (University of Coimbra);Carlos Bento (University of Coimbra);,"2311325342,2095652754","The process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases pursues the goal of extracting useful knowledge from large amounts of data. It comprises a pre-processing step, application of a data-mining algorithm and post-processing of results. When rule induction is applied for data-mining one must be prepared to deal with the generation of a large number of rules. In these circumstances it is important to have a way of selecting the rules that have the highest predictive power. We propose a metric for selection of the n rules with the highest average distance between them. We defend that applying our metric to select the rules that are more distant improves the system prediction capabilities against other criteria for rule selection.

We describe a comprehensive framework in which all these steps can be carried out by means of queries over an inductive database. An inductive database is a database that in addition to data also contains intensionally defined generalizations about the data. We formalize this concept: an inductive database consists of a normal database together with a subset of patterns from a class of patterns, and an evaluation function that tells how the patterns occur in the data. Then, looking for potential query languages built on top of SQL, we consider the research on the MINE RULE operator by Meo, Psaila and Ceri.

Representative association rules and minimum condition maximum consequence association rules,Marzena Kryszkiewicz (Warsaw University of Technology);,98598830,"Discovering association rules (AR) among items in a large database is an important database mining problem. The number of association rules may be large. To alleviate this problem, we introduced in [1] a notion of representative association rules (RR). RR is a least set of rules that covers all association rules. The association rules, which are not representative ones, may be generated by means of a cover operator without accessing a database. On the other hand, a subset of association rules that allows to predict as much as possible from minimum facts is usually of interest to analysts. This kind of rules we will call minimum condition maximum consequence rules (MMR). In this paper, we investigate the relationship between RR and MMR. We prove that MMR is a subset ofRR and it may be extracted from RR.",1998,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,association rule learning;information system;information processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Thus, in analogy to data mining for structured databases, text mining is defined for textual collections. A central tool in text mining is the analysis of concept relationship, which discovers connections between different concepts, as reflected in the corpus. Most previous work on text mining in general, and concept relationship in particular, viewed the entire corpus as one monolithic entity. However, large corpuses are often composed of documents with different characteristics. Most importantly, documents are often tagged with timestamps (e.g. news articles), and thus represent the state of the domain in different time periods. In this paper we introduce a new technique for analyzing and visualizing differences and similarities in the concept relationships, as they are reflected in different segments of the corpus. Focusing on the case of timestamped documents, we introduce Trend Graphs, which provide a graphical tool for analyzing and visualizing the dynamic changes in concept relationships over time. Trend Graphs thus provide a tool for tracking the evaluation of the corpus over time, highlighting trends and discontinuities.",1998,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,graph drawing;information system;data visualization;concept learning;text mining;information processing;data science;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;
Knowledge Discovery with Clustering Based on Rules. Interpreting Results,Karina Gibert (Polytechnic University of Catalonia);Tomàs Aluja (Polytechnic University of Catalonia);Ulises Cortés (Polytechnic University of Catalonia);,"199435517,2176882553,2620163890","It is clear that nowadays analysis of complex systems is an important handicap in Statistics, Artificial Intelligence, Information Systems, Data visualization, and other fields. Describing the structure or obtaining knowledge of complex systems is known as a difficult task. The combination of Data Analysis techniques (including clustering), Inductive Learning (knowledge-based systems), Management of Data Bases and Multidimensional Graphical Representation must produce benefits on this field. Clustering based on rules (CBR) is a methodology developed with the aim of finding the structure of complex domains, which performs better than traditional clustering algorithms or knowledge based systems approaches. In our proposal, a combination of clustering and inductive learning is focussed to the problem of finding and interpreting special patterns (or concepts) from large data bases, in order to extract useful knowledge to represent real-world domains. This methodology and its behaviour as a Knowledge Discovery has been, in fact, presented in previous papers ([3], [5], [2]...). The aim of this paper is to emphasize the reporting phase. Some tools oriented to the interpretation of the clusters are presented; automatic rules generation is presented and applied to a real research. Actually, in a KD system, data preparation and interpretation of the results is as important as the analysis itself. In this paper, missing data treatment is analysed; a statistical test, based on non parametric techniques, for comparing several classifications is presented. Also, a method for finding characteristic values of the classes is presented; this is based on the prototype of each class.

Discovery of Decision Rules from Databases: An Evolutionary Approach,Wojciech Kwedlo (University of Białystok);Marek Kretowski (University of Białystok);,"16003135,1955054257","Decision rules are a natural form of representing knowledge. Their extraction from databases requires the capability for effective scarch large solution spaces. This paper shows, how we can deal with this problem using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). We propose an EA-based system called EDRL, which for each class label sequentially generates a disjunctive set of decision rules in propositional form. EDRL uses an EA to search for one rule at a time; then, all the positive examples covered by the rule are removed from the learning set and the search is repeated on the remaining examples. Our version of EA differs from standard genetic algorithm. In addition to the well-known uniform crossover it employs two non-standard genetic operators, which we call changing condition and insertion. Currently EDRL requires prior discretization of all continuous-valued attributes. A discretization technique based on the minimization of class entropy is used. The performance of EDRL is evaluated by comparing its classification accuracy with that of C4.5 learning algorithm on six datasets from UCI repository.",1998,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,genetic operator;decision rule;information system;genetic algorithm;evolutionary algorithm;information processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Since both discretization and grouping is done with respect to the goal classes, the algorithms are suitable only for classification/prediction tasks.

A Hybrid Approach to Feature Selection,Moussa Boussouf (University of Nantes);,208926277,"The irrelevant and redundant features may degrade the learner speed (due to the high dimensionality) and reduce both the accuracy and comprehensibility of induced model. To cope with these problems, many methods have been proposed to select a subset of pertinent features. In order to evaluate these subsets, two main approaches are generally distinguished: (1) filter approach: which considers only data i.e. algorithm-independent; (2) wrapper approach: which takes into account both data and a given learning algorithm i.e. algorithm-dependent. In this paper, we address the problem of subset selection using α-RST (a generalized rough sets theory). We propose an algorithm to find a set of α-reducts which are non deterministic reducts. To select the best one among them, we also propose a Hybrid Approach by putting filter and wrapper together to overcome the disadvantages of each approach. Our study shows that generally the highest-accuracy-subset is not the best one as regards to the filter criteria.

This allows us to look for the non-linear activation function which best fits the data structure. We present an evaluation criterion and the results and maps obtained with both methods.

It allows MVC to be an efficient preprocessing method: in our experiments with the c4.5[12] decision tree program, MVC has permitted to divide, up to two, the error rate in classification, independently of a significant gain of declarativity.",1998,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,missing data;information processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;

Any systems, approaches or techniques that are concerned with information need to take into account the temporal aspect of data. Data mining refers to a set of techniques for discovering previously unknown information from existing data in large databases and therefore, the information discovered will be of limited value if its temporal aspects, i.e. validity, periodicity, are not considered. This paper presents a generic definition of temporal patterns and a framework for discovering them. A query language for the mining of such patterns is presented in detail.

Cost Sensitive Discretization of Numeric Attributes,Tom Brijs (University of Hasselt);Koen Vanhoof (University of Hasselt);,"2254849676,2242613764","Many algorithms in decision tree leaming are not designed to handle numeric valued attributes very well. Therefore, discretization of the continuous feature space has to be carried out. In this article we introduce the concept of cost sensitive discretization as a preprocessing step to induction of a classifier and as an elaboration of the error-based discretization method to obtain an optimal multi-interval splitting for each numeric attribute. A transparant description of the method and steps involved in cost sensitive discretization is given. We also evaluate its performance against two other well known methods, i.e. entropy-based discretization and pure error-based discretization on a real life financial dataset. From the algoritmic point of view, we show that an important deficiency from error-based discretization methods can be solved by introducing costs. From the application point of view, we discovered that using a discretization method is recommended. To conclude, we use ROC-curves to illustrate that under particular conditions cost-based discretization may be optimal.",1998,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,discretization of continuous features;discretization error;discretization;information processing;machine learning;mathematical optimization;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Discovery of Common Subsequences in Cognitive Evoked Potentials,Arthur Flexer (Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence);Herbert Bauer (University of Vienna);,"2108214723,2159482071",This work is about developing a new method for the analysis of evoked potentials of cognitive activities that combines methods from statistics and sequence alignment to tackle the following two problems: the visualization of high dimensional sequential data and the unsupervised discovery of patterns within this multivariate set of real valued time series data. The sequences of the original high dimensional vectors are transformed to discrete sequences by vector quantization plus Sammon mapping of the codebook. Instead of having to conduct a time-consuming search for common subsequences in the set of multivariate sequential data a multiple sequence alignment procedure can be applied to the set of one-dimensional discrete symbolic time series.

Hence we adapt the reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure to this model which produces an ensemble of trees representing the posterior distribution.

Data Transformation and Rough Sets,Jaroslaw Stepaniuk (Bialystok University of Technology);Marcin Maj (Bialystok University of Technology);,"1979072633,2512863825","Knowledge discovery and data mining systems have to face several difficulties, in particular related to the huge amount of input data. This problem is especially related to inductive logic programming systems, which employ algorithms that are computationally complex. Learning time can be reduced by feeding the ILP algorithm only a well-chosen portion of the original input data. Such transformation of the input data should throw away unimportant clauses but leave ones that are potentially necessary to obtain proper results. In this paper two approaches to data reduction problem are proposed. Both are based on rough set theory. Rough set techniques serve as data reduction tools to reduce the size of input data fed to more time-expensive (search-intensive) ILP techniques. First approach transforms input clauses into decision table form, then uses reducts to select only meaningful data. Second approach introduces a special kind of approximation space. When properly used, iterated lower and upper approximations of target concept have the ability to preferably select facts that are more relevant to the problem, at the same time throwing out the facts that are totally unimportant.",1998,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,rough set;information processing;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

The patterns have a simple syntax and can be translated into regular expressions, which can be used for rapid scanning of databases. Current pattern libraries are built semi-manually, since the correctness of the pattern depends on the incorporation of domain knowledge. Due to the dramatic growth of the databases it is desirable to automate this process.

Overcoming Fragmentation in Decision Trees Through Attribute Value Grouping,K. M. Ho (University of Essex);Paul D.

All the methods considered achieve this goal by grouping the values that each attribute may take. We show how such grouping may be carried out by using either top-down iterative splitting or bottom-up iterative merging. Such methods may be applied either globally at the onset of tree construction or locally whenever a new node is considered. We also compare two approaches to assessing the quality of such attribute value groupings: information gain ratio, as employed in C4.5, and a combination of X 2 and Cramer's V. The results of a comparative study of eight methods show that a top-down global method, using X 2 and Cramer's V, produces consistently smaller tree sizes without loss of accuracy or computation time.

From the Data Mine to the Knowledge Mill: Applying the Principles of Lexical Analysis to the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Process,Jean Moscarola;Richard Bolden;,"2671041345,2664064019","This paper argues that the traditional approach to datamining is dominated by quantitative tools which assume knowledge to be inherent in the data: the data miners task simply being to find it. We propose, however, that true knowledge arises from an interaction between the information and the user. The notion of user interaction in datamining demands a modified approach. An environment must be developed in which the user is encouraged to participate in an interactive learning cycle, where knowledge is progressively extracted from the data. The combined techniques of lexical approximation, hyper-text navigation and quantitative statistics can form the foundation stones of this knowledge mill by permitting a progressive entry into the information and the identification of trends not readily visible via other techniques.

Resampling in an Indefinite Database to Approximate Functional Dependencies,Ethan Collopy (University College London);Mark Levene (University College London);,"2004378514,2164185460","Functional Dependency satisfaction, where the value of one attribute uniquely determines another, may be approximated by Numerical Dependencies (NDs), wherein an attribute set determines at most k attribute sets. Hence, we use NDs to mine a relation to see how well a given FD set is approximated. We motivate NDs by examining their use with indefinite information in relations. The family of all possible ND sets which may approximate an FD set forms a complete lattice. Using this, a proximity metric is presented and used to assess the distance of each resulting ND set to a given FD set. Searching for a definite relation extracted from an indefinite relation which satisfies a given set of FDs, known as the consistency problem, has been shown to be NP-complete. We propose a novel application of the bootstrap, a computer intensive resampling technique, to determine a suitable number of definite relations upon which to apply a heuristic based hill-climbing algorithm which attempts to minimise the distance between the best ND set and the given FD set. The novelty is that we repeatedly apply the bootstrap to an indefinite relation with an increasing sample size until an approximate fixpoint is reached at which point we assume that the sample size is then representative of the indefinite relation. We compare the bootstrap with its predecessor, the jackknife, and conclude that both are applicable with the bootstrap providing additional flexibility.

An Algorithm for Multi-relational Discovery of Subgroups,Stefan Wrobel (Fraunhofer Society);,2113978936,"We consider the problem of finding statistically unusual subgroups in a multi-relation database, and extend previous work on single- relation subgroup discovery. We give a precise definition of the multi-relation subgroup discovery task, propose a specific form of declarative bias based on foreign links as a means of specifying the hypothesis space, and show how propositional evaluation functions can be adapted to the multi-relation setting. We then describe an algorithm for this problem setting that uses optimistic estimate and minimal support pruning, an optimal refinement operator and sampling to ensure efficiency and can easily be parallelized.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,evaluation function;relational database;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

Using methods from computational geometry, we show that this notion of similarity can be computed in polynomial time.

Using Signature Files for Querying Time-Series Data,Henrik André-Jönsson (Linköping University);Dushan Z. Badal (University of Colorado Boulder);,"1772280199,2396328746",This paper describes our work on a new automatic indexing technique for large one-dimensional (1D) or time-series data. The principal idea of the proposed time-series data indexing method is to encode the shape of time-series into an alphabet of characters and then to treat them as text. As far as we know this is a novel approach to 1D data indexing.

An itemset is a group of items bought together in a transaction. The support of an itemset is the ratio of transactions containing the itemset to the total number of transactions. The share of an itemset is the ratio of the count of items purchased together to the total count of items in all transactions. The coincidence of an itemset is the ratio of the count of items in that itemset to the total of those same items in the database. The dominance of an item in an itemset specifies the extent to which that item dominates the total of all items in the itemset. Share based measures have the advantage over support of reflecting accurately how many units are being moved by a business. The share measure can be extended to quantify the financial impact of an itemset on the business.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,data mining;database;artificial intelligence;computer science;

The challenge is to exploit and combine existing algorithms effectively, and help the user during all phases of the KDD process.

Starting from a commercially available system, we develop a scaleable, extensible tool inhercntly based on the view of KDD as an interactive and iterative process.

We then show how the inherent parallelism in domain generalization graphs is exploited by a parallel implementation of the algorithm.

Interactive Interpretation of Hierarchical Clustering,Eric Boudaillier (Électricité de France);Georges Hébrail (Électricité de France);,"2276658662,2507026161","Automatic clustering methods are part of data mining methods. They aim at building clusters of items so that similar items fall into the same cluster while dissimilar ones fall into separate clusters. A particular class of clustering methods are hierarchical ones where recursive clusters are formed to grow a tree representing an approximation of similarities between items. We propose a new interactive interface to help the user to interpret the result of such a clustering process, according to the item characteristics. The prototype has been applied successfully to a special case of items providing nice graphical representations (electric load curves) but can also be used with other types of curves or with more standard items.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,hierarchical clustering of networks;brown clustering;correlation clustering;fuzzy clustering;clustering high dimensional data;hierarchical clustering;cluster analysis;consensus clustering;conceptual clustering;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;
Exploration of Document Collections with Self-Organizing Maps: A Novel Approach to Similarity Representation,Dieter Merkl (RMIT University);,651475416,"Classification is one of the central issues in any system dealing with text data. The need for effective approaches is dramatically increased nowadays due to the advent of massive digital libraries containing free-form documents. What we are looking for are powerful methods for the exploration of such libraries whereby the detection of similarities between the various text documents is the overall goal. In other words, methods that may be used to gain insight in the inherent structure of the various items contained in a text archive are needed. In this paper we demonstrate the applicability of self-organizing maps, a neural network model adhering to the unsupervised learning paradigm, for the task of text document clustering. In order to improve the representation of the result we present an extension to the basic learning rule that captures the movement of the various weight vectors in a two-dimensional output space for convenient visual inspection. The result of the extended training algorithm allows intuitive analysis of the similarities inherent in the input data and most important, intuitive recognition of cluster boundaries.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,digital library;artificial neural network;information retrieval;computer vision;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
Finding Spatial Clusters,Friedrich Gebhardt (Florida Institute of Technology);,2010149010,"The special challenge in analysing geographical data comes from the spatial distribution of the objects. We are interested here in finding out whether a given property is randomly distributed or concentrated somewhere. More exactly: consider a two-dimensional region subdivided into non-overlapping fields, e.g. a state divided into counties, and assume that some fields are marked for having a distinguishing property. Do the marked fields exhibit some spatial clustering? Two tests feasible in data mining situations are proposed here, based on the number fields in clusters (defined by means of triplets, i.e. e. essentially three marked fields with a common boundary point) and on the number of edges of marked fields shared by another marked field. For regular settings such as honeycombs (sets of hexagons) some theoretical results are reported. In addition, simulations have been performed on honeycombs as well as on real subdivisions of a region and the tests have been applied to real data.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,geographic information system;discrete mathematics;data mining;artificial intelligence;computer science;mathematics;
A New and Versatile Method for Association Generation,Amihood Amir (Georgia Institute of Technology);Ronen Feldman (Bar-Ilan University);Reuven Kashi (Bar-Ilan University);,"2155775864,2159469398,1985448312","Current algorithms for finding associations among the attributes describing data in a database have a number of shortcomings: 1. Applications that require associations with very small support have prohibitively large running times. 2. They assume a static database. Some applications require generating associations in real-time from a dynamic database, where transactions are constantly being added and deleted. There are no existing algorithms to accomodate such applications. 3. They can only find associations of the type where a conjunction of attributes implies a conjunction of different attributes. It turns out that there are many cases where a conjunction of attributes implies another conjunction only provided the exclusion of certain attributes. To our knowledge, there is no current algorithm that can generate such excluding associations. We present a novel method for association generation, that answers all three above desiderata. Our method is inherently different from all existing algorithms, and especially suitable to textual databases with binary attributes. At the heart of our algorithm lies the use of subword trees for quick indexing into the required database statistics.

To solve this difficulty, a new approach integrating rough set theory, rule induction and statistical techniques is introduced. First, the Chi-square test is additionally performed in order to reject non-significant attributes. Then, starting from remaining attributes we try to construct such definitions of new attributes that improve finally discovered decision rules.

Searching for Relational Patterns in Data,Sinh Hoa Nguyen (University of Warsaw);Andrzej Skowron (University of Warsaw);,"2318626430,565168613",We consider several basic classes of tolerance relations among objects. These (global) relations are defined from some predefined similarity measures on values of attributes. A tolerance relation in a given class of tolerance relations is optimal with respect to a given decision table A if it contains only pairs of objects with the same decision and the number of such pairs contained in the relation is maximal among all relations from the class. We present a method for (sub-)optimal tolerance relation learning from data (decision table). The presented method is based on rough set approach. We show that for some basic families of tolerance relations this problem can be transformed to a relative geometrical problem in a real affine space. Hence geometrical computations are becoming useful tools for solving the problem of global tolerance relation construction. The complexity of considered problems can be evaluated by the complexity of the corresponding geometrical problems. We propose some efficient heuristics searching for an approximation of optimal tolerance relations in considered families of tolerance relations. The global tolerance relations can be treated as patterns in the cartesian product of the object set.We show how to apply the relational patterns (global tolerance relations) in clustering and classification of objects.,1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,relational database;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

The rough set theory has emphasized the reduction of information necessary to acquire desired knowledge. This is particularly important when we are dealing with time.

When a client decides to move to another bank it usually implies some financial loses. Therefore, banks are very interested in identifying some mechanisms behind such decisions and determining clients that are about to leave the given bank. One way of getting such an insight is to analyse historical data that describe customer behaviour in the past. In this paper we present a methodology and some results of an analysis of a large data set provided by a big mutual fund investment company. Our approach, based on the concept of Rough Data Model, [7], resulted in the identification of key factors that influence customer retention. Moreover, a number of rules that characterise various groups of clients have been generated.

Extraction of Experts' Decision Process from Clinical Databases Using Rough Set Model,Shusaku Tsumoto (Tokyo Medical and Dental University);,122205434,"One of the most important problems on rule induction methods is that they cannot eztract rules, which plausibly represent experts' decision processes. On one hand, rule induction methods induce probabilistic rules, the description length of which is too short, compared with the experts'rules. On the other hand, construction of Bayesian networks generates too lengthy rules. In this paper, the characteristics of experts' rules are closely ezamined and a new approach to eztract plausible rules is introduced, which consists of the following three procedures. First, the characterization of decision attributes (given classes) is extracted from databases and the classes are classified into several groups with respect to the characterization. Then, two kinds of sub-rules, characterization rules for each group and discrimination rules for each class in the group are induced. Finally, those two parts are integrated into one rule for each decision attribute. The proposed method is evaluated on medical databases, the experimental results of which show that induced rules correctly represent experts' decision processes.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,rough set;bayesian network;decision rule;expert system;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;

Recognizing Reliability of Discovered Knowledge,"Petr Berka (University of Economics, Prague);",2148470667,"When using discovered knowledge for decision making (e.g. classification in the case of machine learning), the question of reliability becomes very important. Unlike global view on the algorithms (evaluation of overall accuracy on some testing data) or unlike multistrategy learning (voting of more classifiers), we propose local evaluation for each example using one classifier. The basic idea is to learn to classify the correct decisions made by the classifier. This is done by creating new class attribute match and by running the learning algorithm on the same input attributes. We call this (second) step verification. Some first preliminary experimental results of this method used with C4.5 and CN4 are reported. These results show that: (1) if the classification accuracy is very high, it makes no sence to perform the verification step (since the verification step will create only the majority rule), (2) in multiple-class and/or noisy domains the verification accuracy can be significantly higher then the classification accuracy.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,majority rule;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;

Reducing classification to the problem of finding numerical dependencies we gain an opportunity to utilize powerful regression methods implemented in the PolyAnalyst data miming system. Resulting regression functions can be considered as fuzzy membership indicators for a recognized class. In order to obtain classifying rules, the optimum threshold values which minimize the number of misclassified cases can be found for these functions. We show that this approach allows one to solve the over-fit problem satisfactorily and provides results that are at least not worse than results obtained by the most popular decision tree algorithms.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,nonlinear regression;biological classification;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

The key issue is how to increase both autonomy and versatility of a KDD system. Our methodology is to create an organized society of KDD agents. This means (1) to develop many kinds of KDD agents for different discovery tasks; (2) to use the KDD agents in multiple learning phases in a distributed cooperative mode; (3) to manage the society of KDD agents by multiple meta-control levels. Based on this methodology, a multi-strategy and cooperative KDD system, which can be imagined as a softbot and is named GLS (Global Learning Scheme), has being developing by us. This paper focuses on the meta control levels for increasing both autonomy and versatility of the KDD system.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,formal specification;information system;systems architecture;computer security;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;simulation;computer science;
Induction of Strong Feature Subsets,Mohamed Quafafou (University of Nantes);Moussa Boussouf (University of Nantes);,"2590334644,208926277","The problem of features subset selection can be defined as the selection of a relevant subset of features which allows a learning algorithm to induce small high-accuracy concepts. To achieve this goal, two main approaches have been developed, the first one is algorithm-independent (filter approach) which considers only the data, when the second approach takes into account both the data and a given learning algorithm (wrapper approach). Recent work were developed to study the interest of rough set theory and more particularly its notions of reducts and core to deal with the problem of features subset selection. Different methods were proposed to select features using both the core and the reduct concepts, whereas other researches show that useful features subset does not necessarily contain all features in cores. In this paper, we underline the fact that rough set theory is concerned with deterministic analysis of attribute dependencies which are at basis of the two notions of reduct and core. We extend the notion of dependency which allows us to find both deterministic and non-deterministic dependencies. A new notion of strong reducts is then introduced and leads to the definition of strong feature subsets (SFS). The interest of SFS is illustrated by the improvement of the accuracy of our learning system, called Alpha, on real-world datasets.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,rough set;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
Exploratory Analysis of Biochemical Processes Using Hybrid Modeling Methods,Rimvydas Simutis (Wittenberg University);,2680374388,"A heuristic process data based procedure has been developed that allows a universal time-efficient exploratory analysis of biochemical processes and predictive information extraction from large data sets. It uses artificial neural networks in combination with mass balance equations to represent unknown process relationships between process variables. An efficient algorithm for training of this hybrid system has been developed. The result of the procedure is a numerical representation of the important process relationships that immediately allows to determine improved set points and/or profiles for the manipulated variables with respect to process performance. For illustration, the procedure is applied for extraction of the important relationships in fed-batch bacterial cultivation process.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,universal time;mass balance;hybrid system;artificial neural network;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;computer science;
"A Connectionist Approach to Structural Simiarity Determination as a Basis of Clustering, Classification and Feature Detection",Kristina Schädler (Technical University of Berlin);Fritz Wysotzki (Technical University of Berlin);,"2303164977,296561657","Many algorithms in machine learning, knowledge discovery, pattern recognition and classification are based on the estimation of the similarity or the distance between the analysed objects. Objects with higher structural complexity often cannot be described by feature vectors without losing important structural information. These objects can adequately be represented in the language of logic or by labeled graphs. The similarity of such descriptions is difficult to define and to compute. In this paper, a connectionist approach for the determination of the similarity of arbitrary labeled graphs is introduced. Using an example from organic chemistry, the application of the approach within one distance based and one generalisation based classfication algorithm is demonstrated. The generalisation based algorithm forms clusters or subclasses of similar examples of the same class and extracts the parts of the objects which determine the class of the object. The algorithms perform very satisfactorily in comparison with recent logical and feature vector approaches. Moreover, being able to handle structural data directly, the algorithms need only a subset of the given features of the objects for classification.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,one class classification;feature;structural complexity;feature detection;feature;knowledge extraction;artificial neural network;computer vision;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;computer science;
Bivariate Decision Trees,Jan C. Bioch (Erasmus University Rotterdam);Onno van der Meer (Erasmus University Rotterdam);Rob Potharst (Erasmus University Rotterdam);,"332503799,2417129424,2239016113","Decision tree methods constitute an important and much used technique for classification problems. When such trees are used in a Datamining and Knowledge Discovery context, ease of interpretation of the resulting trees is an important requirement to be met. Decision trees with tests based on a single variable, as produced by methods such as ID3, C4.5 etc., often require a large number of tests to achieve an acceptable accuracy. This makes interpretation of these trees, which is an important reason for their use, disputable. Recently, a number of methods for constructing decision trees with multivariate tests have been presented. Multivariate decision trees are often smaller and more accurate than univariate trees; however, the use of linear combinations of the variables may result in trees that are hard to interpret. In this paper we consider trees with test bases on combinations of at most two variables. We show that bivariate decision trees are an interesting alternative to both uni- and multivariate trees, especially qua ease of interpretation.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,alternating decision tree;decision tree learning;decision tree;knowledge extraction;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;

The Pronciple of Transformation between Efficiency and Effectiveness: Towards a Fair Evaluation of the Cost-Effectiveness of KDD Techniques,Alex Alves Freitas (University of Essex);,2131502281,"Most of the KDD literature focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of KDD techniques, in the sense e.g. of reducing the classification error rate in the case of classification tasks. Efficiency issues are usually considered of secondary importance, it considered at all. In contrast, we focus on the cost-effectiveness of KDD techniques, i.e. on the trade-off between effectiveness (reduction of error rate) and efficiency (reduction of processing time). In particular, we show that a gain in efficiency can be transformed into a gain in effectiveness, and this principle can be used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of KDD systems in a fair manner. We discuss the application of this general principle to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two general kinds of KDD techniques, namely classification algorithms and attribute selection algorithms.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,computer programming;feature selection;computer security;data mining;database;artificial intelligence;machine learning;programming language;algorithm;computer science;
Efficient Multisplitting on Numerical Data,Tapio Elomaa (Tampere University of Technology);Juho Rousu (VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland);,"2303288923,2650907969","Numerical data poses a problem to symbolic learning methods, since numerical value ranges inherently need to be partitioned into intervals for representation and handling. An evaluation function is used to approximate the goodness of different partition candidates. Most existing methods for multisplitting on numerical attributes are based on heuristics, because of the apparent efficiency advantages. We characterize a class of well-behaved cumulative evaluation functions for which efficient discovery of the optimal multisplit is possible by dynamic programming. A single pass through the data suffices to evaluate multisplits of all arities. This class contains many important attribute evaluation functions familiar from symbolic machine learning research. Our empirical experiments convey that there is no significant differences in efficiency between the method that produces optimal partitions and those that are based on heuristics. Moreover, we demonstrate that optimal multisplitting can be beneficial in decision tree learning in contrast to using the much applied binarization of numerical attributes or heuristical multisplitting.",1997,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,evaluation function;decision tree learning;cumulant;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics;algorithm;computer science;mathematics;
