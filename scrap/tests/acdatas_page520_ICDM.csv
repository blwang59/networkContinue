For example, in healthcare domain, we need to learn a predictive model of a certain disease for many hospitals. The models for each hospital may be different because of the inherent differences in the distributions of the patient populations. However, the models are also closely related because of the nature of the learning tasks modeling the same disease. By simultaneously learning all the tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm performs inductive knowledge transfer among tasks to improve the generalization performance. When datasets for the learning tasks are stored at different locations, it may not always be feasible to transfer the data to provide a data centralized computing environment due to various practical issues such as high data volume and privacy. In this paper, we propose a principled MTL framework for distributed and asynchronous optimization to address the aforementioned challenges. In our framework, gradient update does not wait for collecting the gradient information from all the tasks. Therefore, the proposed method is very efficient when the communication delay is too high for some task nodes. We show that many regularized MTL formulations can benefit from this framework, including the low-rank MTL for sharedsubspace learning.

Many classical clustering models such as k-means and DBSCAN are based on heuristics algorithms and suffer from local optimal solutions and numerical instability. Recently convex clustering has received increasing attentions, which leverages the sparsity inducing norms and enjoys many attractive theoretical properties. However, convex clustering is based on Euclidean distance and is thus not robust against outlier features. Since the outlier features are very common especially when dimensionality is high, the vulnerability has greatly limited the applicability of convex clustering to analyze many real-world datasets. In this paper, we address the challenge by proposing a novel robust convex clustering method that simultaneously performs convex clustering and identifies outlier features. Specifically, the proposed method learns to decompose the data matrix into a clustering structure component and a group sparse component that captures feature outliers. We develop a block coordinate descent algorithm which iteratively performs convex clustering after outliers features are identified and eliminated. We also propose an efficient algorithm for solving the convex clustering by exploiting the structures on its dual problem. Moreover, to further illustrate the statistical stability, we present the theoretical performance bound of the proposed clustering method. Empirical studies on synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed robust convex clustering can detect feature outliers as well as improve cluster quality.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: flame clusteringk medians clusteringsubclubrown clusteringcanopy clustering algorithm +22 others

What are the common patterns and the anomalies? How can we use them for algorithm design and applications? A k-core is the maximal subgraph where all vertices have degree at least k. This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis, graph visualization, and graph clustering. Here, we explore pervasive patterns that are related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from several diverse domains. Our discoveries are as follows: (1) Mirror Pattern: coreness of vertices (i.e., maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core) is strongly correlated to their degree. (2) Core-Triangle Pattern: degeneracy of a graph (i.e., maximum k such that the k-core exists in the graph) obeys a 3-to-1 power law with respect to the count of triangles. (3) Structured Core Pattern: degeneracy-cores are not cliques but have non-trivial structures such as core-periphery and communities. Our algorithmic contributions show the usefulness of these patterns. (1) Core-A, which measures the deviation from Mirror Pattern, successfully finds anomalies in real-world graphs complementing densest-subgraph based anomaly detection methods. (2) Core-D, a single-pass streaming algorithm based on Core-Triangle Pattern, accurately estimates the degeneracy of billion-scale graphs up to 7× faster than a recent multipass algorithm.(3) Core-S, inspired by Structured Core Pattern, identifies influential spreaders up to 17× faster than top competitors with comparable accuracy.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: degeneracydistance hereditary graphcomplement graphforbidden graph characterization1 planar graph +18 others

The use of data generated by online activities of healthyindividuals offers the opportunity to perform such observationson the large scales and for the long periods that are required. Various studies have previously examined circadian fluctuationsof mood in this way. In this study, we investigate seasonalfluctuations in mood and mental health by analyzing the accesslogs of Wikipedia pages and the content of Twitter in the UK overa period of four years. By using standard methods of NaturalLanguage Processing, we extract daily indicators of negativeaffect, anxiety, anger and sadness from Twitter and comparethis with the overall daily traffic to Wikipedia pages aboutmental health disorders. We show that both negative affect onTwitter and access to mental health pages on Wikipedia follow anannual cycle, both peaking during the winter months. Breakingthis down into specific moods and pages, we find that peakaccess to the Wikipedia page for Seasonal Affective Disordercoincides with the peak period for the sadness indicator inTwitter content, with both most over-expressed in Novemberand December. A period of heightened anger and anxiety onTwitter partly overlaps with increased information seeking aboutstress, panic and eating disorders on Wikipedia in the late winterand early spring. Finally, we compare Twitter mood indicatorswith various weather time series, finding that negative affectand anger can be partially explained in terms of the climatictemperature and photoperiod, sadness can be partially explainedby the photoperiod and the perceived change in the photoperiod, while anxiety is partially explained by the level of precipitation.

In this work we introduce a novel scalable algorithm for time series subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search. For exceptionally large datasets, the algorithm can be trivially cast as an anytime algorithm and produce high-quality approximate solutions in reasonable time. The exact similarity join algorithm computes the answer to the time series motif and time series discord problem as a side-effect, and our algorithm incidentally provides the fastest known algorithm for both these extensively-studied problems.

Many multi-view and multi-domain network clustering methods have been developed for joint multi-network clustering. These methods typically assume there is a common clustering structure shared by all networks, and different networks can provide complementary information on this underlying clustering structure. However, this assumption is too strict to hold in many emerging real-life applications, where multiple networks have diverse data distributions. More popularly, the networks in consideration belong to different underlying groups. Only networks in the same underlying group share similar clustering structures. Better clustering performance can be achieved by considering such groups differently. As a result, an ideal method should be able to automatically detect network groups so that networks in the same group share a common clustering structure. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, ComClus, to simultaneously group and cluster multiple networks. ComClus treats node clusters as features of networks and uses them to differentiate different network groups.

The AAD approach is designed to operate in an interactive data exploration loop.

And the adaptive context-specific transition matrices capture how lengths of time intervals between adjacent behaviors in historical sequences affect the transition of global sequential features.

In order to parallelize SGD on multi-core machines, asynchronous SGD (Hogwild!) has been proposed, where each core updates a global model vector stored in a shared memory simultaneously, without using explicit locks. We show that the scalability of Hogwild! on modern multi-socket CPUs is severely limited, especially on NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) system, due to the excessive cache invalidation requests and false sharing. In this paper we propose a novel decentralized asynchronous SGD algorithm called HogWild++ that overcomes these drawbacks and shows almost linear speedup on multi-socket NUMA systems. The main idea in HogWild++ is to replace the global model vector with a set of local model vectors that are shared by a cluster (a set of cores), keep them synchronized through a decentralized token-based protocol that minimizes remote memory access conflicts and ensures convergence. We present the design and experimental evaluation of HogWild++ on a variety of datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art parallel SGD implementations in terms of efficiency and scalability.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: multi core processorinstruction setscalabilityalgorithm designcomputational model +6 others

Topics that were used by the party to draw attention to their program included the Euro-crisis and the so-called 'refugee crisis'. We investigate some aspects of social media use of the AfD. Our goal is to relate the rise of this party to some quantitative measures of their social media usage. A particular focus will be placed on users that interact with AfD content as well as with content of other parties. Our analysis is based on more than 11 million interactions of more than one million users with the public Facebook pages of the major German political parties during the years 2014 and 2015. Investigating the time courses of social media activity and user interaction, we find that the rise of the AfD can be associated with an amount of social media coverage and user engagement that is unprecedented in the German political landscape. One main effect of this campaign is a substantial increase of user interactions with other parties from the right spectrum, suggesting a migration of voters from established right wing parties. In order to better interpret the dynamics of social media activity, we relate the analysed metrics to the textual content of the posts and classical survey data. These results suggest that the intense use of social media platforms poses a major success factor of this newly emerging right-wing party.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: votingmeasurementworld wide webdata mining

In recent years, several methods have been proposed for discovering causal structure from observational data. These methods, however, focus specifically on numeric data, and are not applicable on nominal or binary data. In this work, we focus on causal inference for binary data. Simply put, we propose causal inference by compression. To this end we propose an inference framework based on solid information theoretic foundations, i.e. Kolmogorov complexity. However, Kolmogorov complexity is not computable, and hence we propose a practical and computable instantiation based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. To apply the framework in practice, we propose ORIGO, an efficient method for inferring the causal direction from binary data. ORIGO employs the lossless PACK compressor, works directly on the data and does not require assumptions about neither distributions nor the type of causal relations. Extensive evaluation on synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data shows that ORIGO discovers meaningful causal relations, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: informaticsbenchmarkdecision treeinformation theorytheoretical computer science +5 others

Each facet in the atlas represents a distinct interpretation of how the network can be meaningfully decomposed and organized.

It allows a first glimpse of possible structure in the data, which can inform the choice of analyses used. Its uses are multiple. It can give the user an idea as to the clusterability or linear separability of the data. It can help spot outliers, or can hint at the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. Moreover, it can sometimes reveal unexpected latent dimensions in the data. With all these uses, MDS is increasingly used in areas as diverse as marketing, medicine, genetics, music and linguistics. One of the strengths of MDS is that it is essentially agnostic to data type, as we can use any distance measure to create the distance matrix, which is the only required input to the MDS algorithm. In spite of this generality, we make the following claim. MDS is not (well) defined for an increasingly important data type, time series subsequences. In this work we explain why this is the case, and we propose a scalable solution. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas on several diverse real-world datasets.

Pervasive sensors, such as wearable devices, have an increasing market penetration and generate a tremendous amount of data. The myriad of available clinical and consumer-grade wearables generate a continuous time series of a person's daily physical exertion and rest. Applying HAR to the activity time series can provide new insights by enriching the feature set in health studies, and enhancing the personalisation and effectiveness of health, wellness, and fitness applications. The analyses of complex health behaviours such as sleep, traditionally require a time-consuming manual interpretation by experts. This manual work is necessary due to the erratic periodicity and persistent noisiness of human behaviour. In this paper, we present a robust automated human activity recognition algorithm, which we call RAHAR. We test our algorithm in the application area of sleep research by providing a novel framework for evaluating sleep quality and examining the correlation between the aforementioned and an individual's physical activity. Our results improve the state-of-the-art procedure in sleep research by 15% for area under ROC and by 30% for F1 score on average.

In this paper we present a new non-parametric calibration method called Ensemble of Near Isotonic Regression (ENIR). The method can be considered as an extension of BBQ, a recently proposed calibration method, as well as the commonly used calibration method based on isotonic regression (IsoRegC). ENIR is designed to address the key limitation of IsoRegC which is the monotonicity assumption of the predictions. Similar to BBQ, the method post-processes the output of a binary classifier to obtain calibrated probabilities. Thus it can be used with many existing classification models to generate accurate probabilistic predictions. We demonstrate the performance of ENIR on synthetic and real datasets for commonly applied binary classification models. Experimental results show that the method outperforms several common binary classifier calibration methods. In particular on the real data, ENIR commonly performs statistically significantly better than the other methods, and never worse. It is able to improve the calibration power of classifiers, while retaining their discrimination power. The method is also computationally tractable for large scale datasets, as it is O(N log N) time, where N is the number of samples.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelingprobabilistic logichistogramcalibrationpredictive modelling +7 others

We develop a novel lag-sensitive hashing technique to cluster user accounts into correlated sets in near real-time. Our method, named DeBot, detects thousands of bots per day with a 94% precision and generates reports online everyday. In September 2016, DeBot has accumulated about 544,868 unique bots in the previous one year. We compare our detection technique with per-user techniques and with Twitter's suspension system.

We argue that in order to make database analytics usable, we should use or develop algorithms that are effective over a wide range of choices of structural organizations.

However, in practice up to 20% of the records may contain errors in identifiers. Thus, exact record linkage on encrypted identifiers usually results in the loss of large subsets of the data. Such losses usually imply biased statistical estimates since the causes of errors might be correlated with the variables of interest in many applications. Over the past 10 years, the field of Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) has developed different techniques to link data without revealing the identity of the described entity. However, only few techniques are suitable for applied research with large data bases that include millions of records, which is typical for administrative or medical data bases. Bloom filters were found to be one successful technique for PPRL when large scale applications are concerned. Yet, Bloom filters have been subject to cryptographic attacks. Previous research has shown that the straight application of Bloom filters has a non-zero re-identification risk. We present new results on recently developed techniques defying all known attacks on PPRL Bloom filters.

PPRL approaches are increasingly required in many real-world application areas ranging from healthcare to national security. Previous approaches to PPRL have mostly focused on linking only two databases. Scaling PPRL to several databases is an open challenge since privacy threats as well as the computation and communication costs increase significantly with the number of databases involved.

In domains like clothing recommendation, this task is particularly challenging since a successful system should be capable of handling a large corpus of items, a huge amount of relationships among them, as well as the high-dimensional and semantically complicated features involved. Furthermore, the human notion of ""compatibility"" to capture goes beyond mere similarity: For two items to be compatible—whether jeans and a t-shirt, or a laptop and a charger—they should be similar in some ways, but systematically different in others. In this paper we propose a novel method, Monomer, to learn complicated and heterogeneous relationships between items in product recommendation settings. Recently, scalable methods have been developed that address this task by learning similarity metrics on top of the content of the products involved. Here our method relaxes the metricity assumption inherent in previous work and models multiple localized notions of 'relatedness,' so as to uncover ways in which related items should be systematically similar, and systematically different.

In order to predict user actions such as the next product to purchase, movie to watch, or place to visit, it is essential to take into account both long-term user preferences and sequential patterns (i.e., short-term dynamics). Matrix Factorization and Markov Chain methods have emerged as two separate but powerful paradigms for modeling the two respectively. Combining these ideas has led to unified methods that accommodate long-and short-term dynamics simultaneously by modeling pairwise user-item and item-item interactions. In spite of the success of such methods for tackling dense data, they are challenged by sparsity issues, which are prevalent in real-world datasets. In recent years, similarity-based methods have been proposed for (sequentially-unaware) item recommendation with promising results on sparse datasets. In this paper, we propose to fuse such methods with Markov Chains to make personalized sequential recommendations. We evaluate our method, Fossil, on a variety of large, real-world datasets.

For example, in recommendation, multiple matrices may exist as user x movie and user x book, while correlations among the multiple domains can be reasonably exploited to improve the quality of matrix completion. In this paper, we consider the problem of aligned matrix completion, where multiple matrices are recovered that correspond to different representations of the same group of objects.

In this paper, we revise the notion of motif support, characterizing it as the number of patterns or repetitions that define a motif. We then propose GENMOTIF, a genetic algorithm to discover motifs with support which, at the same time, is flexible enough to accommodate other motif specifications and task characteristics. GENMOTIF is an anytime algorithm that easily adapts to many situations: searching in a range of segment lengths, applying uniform scaling, dealing with multiple dimensions, using different similarity and grouping criteria, etc. GENMOTIF is also parameter-friendly: it has only two intuitive parameters which, if set within reasonable bounds, do not substantially affect its performance. We demonstrate the value of our approach in a number of synthetic and real-world settings, considering traffic volume measurements, accelerometer signals, and telephone call records.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: database indexinterpolationtime seriesgenetic algorithmapproximation algorithm +6 others

In such applications, it is typical to first encode relationships between the data samples using an appropriate similarity function. Popular neighborhood construction techniques such as k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs are known to be very sensitive to the choice of parameters, and more importantly susceptible to noise and varying densities. In this paper, we propose the use of quantile analysis to obtain local scale estimates for neighborhood graph construction. To this end, we build an auto-encoding neural network approach for inferring conditional quantiles of a similarity function, which are subsequently used to obtain robust estimates of the local scales. In addition to being highly resilient to noise or outlying data, the proposed approach does not require extensive parameter tuning unlike several existing methods. Using applications in spectral clustering and single-example label propagation, we show that the proposed neighborhood graphs outperform existing locally scaled graph construction approaches.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: matrix decompositionrobustnessdata analysisartificial neural networkdata mining +4 others

Academic performance could be affected with factors like personality, skills, social environment, the use of library books and so on. However, it is still less investigated that how could the use of library books affect academic performance of college students and even leverage book-loan history for predicting academic performance. To this end, we propose a supervised content-aware matrix factorization for mutual reinforcement of academic performance prediction and library book recommendation. This model not only addresses the sparsity challenge by explainable dimension reduction techniques, but also promotes library book recommendation by recommending ""right"" books for students based on their performance levels and book meta information. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model on three years of the book-loan history and cumulative grade point average of 13,047 undergraduate students in one university. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the competing baselines on both tasks, and that academic performance is not only predictable from the book-loan history but also improves the recommendation of library books for students.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: predictive modellingpredictionlinear programmingdata sciencemultimedia +4 others

In order for these annotations to be accurate, they must be the result of a precise experiment or measurement. However, in some cases additional weak guidance might be given by imprecise measurements, a domain expert or even crowd sourcing. Current formulations of regression are unable to use both types of guidance. We propose a regression framework that can also incorporate weak guidance based on relative orderings, bounds, neighboring and similarity relations. Consider learning to predict ages from portrait images, these new types of guidanceallowweakerformsofguidancesuchasstating a person is in their 20s or two people are similar in age.

Predicting COPD failure provides a prognostic warning of death or readmission, and is crucial to early intervention and decision-making. The aim of this study is to perform COPD failure prediction on longitudinal data. To address the inappropriate estimation of Cox hazard in current approaches, we propose a new representation of hazard to capture the relationship between survival probability and time-varying risk factors in a concise but effective way. To optimize model parameters, we design and maximize a new joint likelihood that comprises two components used to estimate survival status separately for failure and censored patients. A regularized optimization is performed on the joint likelihood to prevent overfitting arising from model learning. Our approach is applied to a real-life COPD data set and outperforms the current state-of-the-art prediction models in terms of the survival AUC, concordance index and Birer score metrics, this reveals that the great promise of our approach for clinical prediction.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: data modelinghazarddatabase indexpredictive modellingmathematical model +5 others

But studying real-world communities reveals that they have more structure than that. In particular, the nodes can be ordered in such a way that (almost) all edges in the community lie below a hyperbola. In this paper we present three new models for communities that capture this phenomenon. Our models explain the structure of the communities differently, but we also prove that they are identical in their expressive power. Our models fit to real-world data much better than traditional block models or previously-proposed hyperbolic models, both of which are a special case of our model. Our models also allow for intuitive interpretation of the parameters, enabling us to summarize the shapes of the communities in graphs effectively.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: informaticsdata modelingcommunity structureprobabilistic logiccomputational model +9 others
