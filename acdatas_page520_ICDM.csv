Survey on Histogram Equalization method based Image Enhancement techniques,Nithyananda C RRamachandra A C (Alpha College of Engineering)Preethi,"2479462308,2317603419,2696359466","Image Enhancement is the process of improving the image quality for better visibility of images. The visibility and look of image will be decided by human eyes, which varies from person to person. The images resulted by quality measures made by hardware and software may not be always good and are not having natural look. Many methods are introduced to enhance images. Histogram Equalization is the method in which, the histograms of the input images are altered to obtain the enhanced images. In this paper, we studied various methods of Histogram Equalization, the different types are briefly explained and placed in chronological order in table.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: adaptive histogram equalizationhistogram matchingimage histogramhistogram equalizationcolor histogram +10 others

Hence, energy efficient routing protocols are required to find the efficient route to minimize the communication overhead. Security is another important factor in WSN. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) need effective security mechanisms because these networks are usually deployed in hostile, unattended environments where the speed and accuracy of data collection is very important. In this study, we propose an energy aware heuristic-based routing protocol scheme to provide energy efficiency and security in WSNs.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: key distribution in wireless sensor networkswireless routing protocolmobile wireless sensor networklink state routing protocolzone routing protocol +9 others

Approaches on Personal Data Privacy Preserving in Cloud: A Survey,Guihong ChenYiju Zhan Qingling Cai,"2675039246,2525766462","MANET is collection of wireless nodes which are connected to each other, but all nodes are independent. They can communicate each other via intermediate nodes or directly. In order to increase the lifetime of the network, routing must be energy efficient. Routing protocols like DSR, ECDSR, AODV, TORA, DSDV, EEAODR, and EPAR are proposed for MANET. Design of energy efficient routing protocol is the key issue for mobile ad hoc networks. One difficulty with routing protocols in MANET is to know which protocol performs best in which situation. Since protocols exhibit advantages and disadvantages based on certain context, it is quite difficult to determine. This paper provides an insight into the facts of proactive, reactive and hybrid routing protocols that are used in MANET. ECDSR protocol selects nodes on the basis of minimum threshold energy. As ECDSR protocol has overhearing and stale route problem, which leads to packet loss and over energy consumption. In our paper we reviewed the solution to address overhearing and stale route problem by suggesting modification in ECDSR protocol.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: hazy sighted link state routing protocolad hoc wireless distribution servicedsrflowrouting domainenhanced interior gateway routing protocol +20 others

Zeki (International Islamic University Malaysia)Akeem Olowolayemo,"2687127545,1968999749,2677978833","Search reranking is regarded as a common way to boost image retrieval precision. The problem is not simple especially when there are multiple features to be considered for search, which often happens in image retrieval. This paper proposes the combination of Circular reranking and Time-based reranking methods for improving the precision of image retrieval. Circular reranking utilises multiple features of an image, usually textual and visual descriptions, for reranking. Initially, it will conduct multiple runs of random walk for obtaining initial search results. Secondly, two features of an image are exchanged for better mutual reinforcement which makes multiple keyword search possible. Lastly, reranked results are attained through exchanging the ranking scores among different features in a cyclic manner. Time-based reranking is based on the count of Time, View and Download, of an image. Time count is the time duration between opening and closing of an image. View and Download counts are the total number of views and downloads respectively for an image. In our approach, Time-based reranking is performed on the Circular reranked list for improving precision, appropriately combining features of both reranking methods, while retrieving images during search.",2016,International Conference on Data Mining,Fields of study: visualizationimage retrievalinformation retrievalcomputer visionpattern recognition +1 other
