Multidimensional Association Rules in Boolean Tensors,Kim-Ngan T. Nguyen (University of Lyon);Marc Plantevit (University of Lyon);,"2132356875,107359601","Popular data mining methods support knowledge discovery from patterns that hold in binary relations. We study the generalization of association rule mining within arbitrary n-ary relations and thus Boolean tensors instead of Boolean matrices. Indeed, many datasets of interest correspond to relations whose number of dimensions is greater or equal to 3. However, just a few proposals deal with rule discovery when both the head and the body can involve subsets of any dimensions. A challenging problem is to provide a semantics to such generalized rules by means of objective interestingness measures that have to be carefully designed. Therefore, we discuss the need for different generalizations of the classical confidence measure. We also present the first algorithm that computes, in such a general framework, every rule that satisfies both a minimal frequency constraint and minimal confidence constraints. The approach is tested on real datasets (ternary and 4-ary relations). We report on a case study that deals with analyzing a dynamic graph thanks to rules.",2011,SIAM International Conference on Data Mining,discrete mathematics;combinatorics;data mining;machine learning;statistics;mathematics;
